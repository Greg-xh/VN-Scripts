We set off, stopping at the first caf｣ Hina was interested in and ordered a famous cake set.
...I dunno, that place wasn't as good as people said it was...
Hina mumbled hesitantly after we left the store.
It was kind of lacking... It wasn't nearly as moist or sweet compared to your cakes, Ken-chan...
I thought it would taste better since it was an old, traditional-looking store, but... It was just too plain. Mmm...
Really? I thought it tasted pretty good. I get why everyone talks about it on TV and in magazines, and why there's always a huge line to get in.
Besides, subtle flavors have been all the rage these days, so they're keeping up with the current trend.
Hmm, I guess. It doesn't taste bad, but your cakes are definitely ten times better!
H-Huh, really? Th-Thanks. I'm glad to hear it, but it's kind of embarrassing... Haha.
Hina's a huge fan of my cakes, after all. Looks like she even prefers them to the sweets of an established, famous store. 
Let's go to the next one, then. There are a bunch of places I want to visit today, so we're gonna be super busy!
Sure... Where are we going now?
Well, the next one is actually an up-and-coming store... It's a new place that opened recently.
I walked alongside Hina as she shot me a cheerful grin, but looked a bit unsatisfied.
There's actually a wide variety of caf｣s that work with handmade sweets.
The thought that each store hosted all sorts of p｡tissiers was fascinating to me. That realization made me want travel the world and taste all the sweets that ever existed.
