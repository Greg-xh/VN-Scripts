I don't mind going on a date, but what do you even want to do? Did you have something specific in mind?
Yeah! I wanna go to the movies, a tea house, a bowling alley, a great restaurant, and do karaoke!
That's quite a list...
We don't get a lot of time off, so I want to make the most of it.
Should I narrow that list down?
Nah. I want you to have a good time today, so let's do everything!
Yay! I knew I could count on you!
I'm not sure what you were expecting from me, but let's go all out today!
Hehe, I'm so happy!
