Welcome, may I take your order?
Michiyo-san greeted our customers with a lovely smile.
Haha... Having a poster girl sure is nice.
It was nice watching her, if a little embarrassing.
I mean, quite a bit has happened lately... 
Ah...
Um...
Michiyo-san turned to me. 
Our eyes met, but I looked away with flushed cheeks.
Heheh...
Ah... 
Ahaha, good job there... Heheh... 
She smiled back at me softly. It was a sweet, adorable smile. 
I lost my breath for a moment when faced with that beautiful, yet bashful smile.
(I'm so happy we made up... When I think about not being able to see that smile again...)
(Aaaah, I'm so happy we made up! I really am... I'm so happy...!)
I was over the moon, but couldn't quite put those feelings into words just yet.
Heheheh... Heheh.
Ah, welcome. Please take a seat...
