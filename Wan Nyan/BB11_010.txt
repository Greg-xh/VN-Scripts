All right, let's go with this!
Um, one?
Oh! That would be me, then. Happy to be your partner, Kenta-kun.
Same here. 
How did the rest of you do?
Quite badly, if I do say so myself! Why do I have to team up with Makoto and not with Yanushi-kun?!
It was just the luck of the draw.
You seem to be taking this too well! Were you planning on teaming up with me for some devious reason?!
I'm just not childish enough to complain about something being decided by chance.
Grrr! Are you implying{W:700} I'm{W:0} childish?!
You're not being very mature right now, if nothing else.
You're so annoying!
Micchan, Nono-chan, and I are partners. Let's have fun!
Y-Yeah... Fun...
Please help me get through this...
You're both kind of pale... Are you okay? 
"Okay" isn't how I'd put it...
I agree... Tests of courage are the devil's work...
Hehe, you're shaking all over! You two are so cute.
This is no laughing matter!
Yeah, it's not funny at all.
It might be scary when you're alone, but it'll be okay so long as we're together. We'll even hold hands.
That's true... This is preferable to going alone...
If you get scared halfway through, you can even glomp me if you want. Hehe.
You... sound oddly happy about that.
Group one will go first, and then the next group will follow ten minutes later.
Right, no problem. 
Ready to go, Kenta-kun?
Sure.
