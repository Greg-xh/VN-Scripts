All that excitement kept me up all night, and morning finally came.
As promised, I waited for Hina in front of the Kitty Parlor.
(I guess I showed up a bit too early... But she should be here soon...)
Ken-chan, good morning! Did you wait long?
No, I just got here. I mean, the dorms are right there, haha...
As we got our pre-date cliche conventions (?) out of the way, we smiled at each other.
I couldn't work up the nerve to start a normal conversation with her, even though this wasn't an issue before.
Ken-chan? What's wrong? 
Ah, no, it's nothing... W-We should get going, um, ah... 
We were just walking together, but my heart was beating like crazy. This didn't make even a bit of sense. 
We were together all the time, and I'd spent a countless amount of time with her at my side, so why...
Uh, um... So, uhm, where are we off to today? 
Our date consists of... going around and trying all of the cakes at the local bakeries!
We're hitting up the local bakeries, huh?
I went along with the conversation to hide my embarrassment. It was a predictable, if not a bit surprising idea, but it was distinctly Hina-like. 
There's just so many famous shops in Tokyo. I got the chance to come all the way here, so not trying them all out would be a waste, wouldn't it?
I see. That's very much like you. Well, I'll stick with you through thick and thin today. Ahahaha...
We're shipping out, so let's go! To Tokyo's best bakeries and beyond! Heheheh!
I couldn't help but crack a smile. Hina never changed a bit...
We started our date by going to some of the restaurants Hina had her eye on, intending to try them all out as a p｡tissier in training of sorts.
