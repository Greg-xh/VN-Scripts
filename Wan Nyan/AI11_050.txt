Yet another busy day passed us by and it was finally time to close...
I'll be going back, then. 
Good job today, everyone! Today was real busy. Phew~ It was fun, but I'm exhausted...
Indeed. Let's head back, then... We should rest in preparation for tomorrow. 
I'll stay here for a bit. There's a cake I want to try making. 
Oh, really? Aren't you tired, though? Will you be all right? 
...Someone's enthusiastic.
Don't push yourself too hard, though.
Yeah, don't worry. Thanks, though. Good work today.
I'm off, then! I'll see you tomorrow, Onii-chan.
...I'll be going on ahead. 
Yes, I'll be going back, too. I'll see you tomorrow... 
Yeah, see you guys tomorrow. Good night...
I waved goodbye to the girls, who were concerned for my well-being, then turned my gaze to the kitchen.
(Okay, let's get started!)
