Good morning, Shinono-chan. 
Good morning. The weather sure is nice out.
Mhm! I'm sure we'll be busy today.
...By the way, why are you two in your work uniforms? Didn't you just come back from the shop?
Senpai and I were doing a study session on how to make sweets.
It was moreso him teaching me...
That's unfair! Why didn't you invite me?!
It was early and you were asleep.
You still should've woken me up!
It would've woken up the others, though...
Jeez! You better call me next time you study together!
Sure. I'll keep that in mind.
You better!
Yes, yes. Anyway, let's head in.
Ugggh! You better not forget!
