Nnn, uhh, I don't feel like getting up. I'm going back to sleep...
I stayed up late last night coming up with a new dessert... Mmm, nnn...
???
Should I turn off your alarm, then?
Yeah, please... 
???
All right. One click and... sweet dreams, Kenta.
Yeah, good night... 
...
...?
Wait, who's there?!
Good meowning! It's me, of course. 
Wait, Kenta, were you expecting to see someone else in your bed...?
If that's the case, as your partner, I've got some serious questions for you, mister.
Not to worry, you're the only who sneaks into my bed without permission. Jeez... What do you mean by "partner"?
I've already explained it. If we work together, we can become amazing confectionery artisans.
I'll perfect my craft, and you'll master cakes. Our goals may be different, but our wish to see people smile and hear their praise is the same.
That's what I'd like to make, and to someday evolve beyond what I can do now. If there's some traditional confection lost to time, I want to recreate it!
There are so many things I want to do... You feel the same way, right?
Yeah, I can agree with that.
I might not be able to do it alone, but I think I can do it with you by my side...
Makoto... Hearing you say that makes me happy.
Right? That's why we're partners. To accomplish our dreams, and fulfill each other sexually!
Sexually...?
Ah, sorry. I, of course, meant that in a conceptual sense. You're very important to me, and were also my first... so it's all the same.
Makoto was usually levelheaded, but became really assertive when it came to these topics... My instincts warned me to not get caught up in it.
Ah, yeah. Right... 
You're kind of cold, Kenta. Maybe you're only after my body.
Dummy, that's not...!
Not what?
Wha... You're looking awfully curious. 
Of course I am. Maybe you feel the same as I do. That's all I want, you know?
...
T-Time to get up, then. Shouldn't you head back to your room? You need to change into your uniform.
Not to worry, darling, I brought them with me. I did forget my panties, though... I'm not wearing any right now, actually!
Ah! M-Makoto!
Ahahahah! Kenta, you're turning red!
Meow, meoooooooooooow!
Come on... Let's do it before Muffmeow wakes up... okay?
Absolutely not. We don't have time, and doing it this early is kind of...
So we can do it any other time? If you want to do it tonight, then I'll be patient.
Ugh... Fine. I'll hang out with you tonight. Now I gotta get up or I'll end up running late for the store. 
Heheh. It's a promise. You really are a lewd boy, aren't you? Saying you'll make love to me tonight... Teehee. 
...Jeez.
Makoto would always take control of the conversation whenever we were alone. I really was no match for her...
It's not all bad, though.
