Let's start tasting the samples. Give your honest opinions, okay?
Of course. I have every intention of it.
I'm kinda nervous. 
How goes it, my hardworkin' peons?
Madam Chairwoman, Nee-san.
We came to check on you. 
Good timing. We're trying out samples of potential menu items. Would you like to join us?
Fo sho! I totally want to!
I don't mind, either. 
That only makes me even more nervous...
Not a big deal. I'm not ashamed to present my dish.
Neither am I!
Come now, let's start!
Everyone
Let's dig in! 
This is great... Who made this?
That one's mine. 
It looks like a normal pancake, but it's totally different. It's really soft and fluffy. I could eat this forever and never have enough. 
Who made this cookie?
What's wrong with it?!
Nothing, it just makes sense. I'd expect this level of quality from you.
Wh-Why, of course it is! So you{W:700} can{W:0} say something nice for once!
I'm always honest. I'm not rotten enough a person to call something that tastes good "gross."
Well, as the daughter of a Western confectionary, how would you rate my pound cake?
Since you bothered asking, I'll give you an honest evaluation. Om...
Uwah!
What do you think? If there's anything I should improve, please tell me.
...There's nothing. I admit this is an exceptional cake.
That's great to hear. Your approval makes me very proud to have made it, then.
Wh-Why...? I wouldn't be able to make a pound cake this good... This is frustrating!
This roll cake is delectable. It's like the cream's sweetness is wrapping up the fruits' sourness. 
I can't help but admire how moist the sponge is. 
Th-Thank you very much. 
If we change the fruit according to the season, we can serve this year-round.
Well, the exam's only durin' the summer.
Anywhoozle, this chiffon cake is the bomb!
This chill, relaxed flavor is perfect for an adult like me!
Adult, huh...?
Didja say somethin', Fuumin?
Not a word. 
That's not what it sounded like to_Whoa! This honey toast is super good!
That one's mine! 
Nice goin'! The honey's sweetness is meltin' in my mouth...
It's quite good... Especially the bread. It's of much higher-quality than what's sold on the market. 
Your family runs a bakery, right, Korone-chan?
Yeah, and I've been helping out ever since I was little. 
That makes sense. This doesn't seem like somethin' a student could make. You're already at a pro level!
Thank you very much! 
Does that mean this tarte is Yanushi's?
That's right. 
Om... The banana and gelatin's mellow flavor, along with the strawberry's sourness, are truly splendid.
Let's see... Oooh! You're right! It's super mega tasty! 
I want to try it, too!
Me too! 
This is... truly Yanushi-kun's talent. 
It's amazing you could make something{W:700} this{W:0} good. I knew my impression of you wasn't wrong. 
I could easily eat three of these!
That's called gluttony...
Hmm... All of these are so yummy! Why not put them all up for sale tomorrow?
We have the chairwoman's approval, so why not?
We kind of decided on the spot, didn't we?
That just shows how talented you all are.
Anyway, it's time to clean up and head back!
Okaaay.
