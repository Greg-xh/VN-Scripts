Pheeew, I'm pooped! 
Since I'm the only guy, I was responsible for doing all the heavy lifting for both stores. It was incredibly exhausting.
If all my efforts led to their happiness, then my fatigue was well worth it.
It was a bit early, but I considered turning in for the night in preparation for tomorrow.
Okay...!
All right, time for bed. Good night!
...
Ugh, I can't fall asleep!
I was physically drained, but my mind was restless.
What should I do? I won't get any sleep at this rate...
Hmm... Maybe a short walk would do me some good?
