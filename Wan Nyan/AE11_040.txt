Good morning!
I'm the last one here... Wait, everyone's already changed into their uniform!
You're late, Onii...
You made it just in time. Where were you?
I was lying down on the roof, looking at the sky. 
My, that sounds rather pleasant. 
You bet! It was warm and the wind felt great. I almost dozed off up there.
I'd be inclined to believe you fell asleep.
Nah, I was just watching the clouds and lost track of time.
Hehe, I can imagine how you felt.
Oh, I remember something like that happening back in school. 
Really?
Did you forget? It was back when the committee ran out of materials and you went out to buy more.
You didn't come back and we assumed the worst, so we went out looking for you. We found you lying down next to the river bank and looking up at the clouds.
That actually happened?
Yeah, it sure did. 
You invited me to join and we ended up watching the sky until it got dark.
Because of that, they closed the school gate and we got in trouble.
Ooooh, right, that! Something like that did happen.
I'm surprised you actually stuck with him until the sun went down, Nekohana-san.
Ahahaha, oh, it just happened. 
You haven't changed a bit, Kenta.
He'll never grow up.
No, no! I've definitely matured!
Not from where I'm looking. 
Heheheh. 
Come to think of it, you're still the same person as when you first came to train with us.
I second that notion.
R-Really? I haven't matured...?
You have, but your personality hasn't changed.
Yup, yup. That's right.
What's the difference? 
Figure that one out for yourself.
Agreed.
Whaaaaaaaaaaaat...
Speaking of which, you should hear what Ken-chan did when I first met him.
It must be some manner of buffoonery. 
Oh? What is it? I wanna know!
Well, it happened when he came to our storeｩ
(They're all getting worked up over stories from when he was traveling!)
(It's not fair... They all made memories with Onii-chan while I was away!)
(I can't stand this! I have to do something!)
