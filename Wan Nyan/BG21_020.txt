Guess I should head back now. 
Yanushi, do you have a minute? 
Sure, what is it? 
Forgive me. I apologize from the bottom of my heart. 
H-Hey, you don't have to bow. What are you even apologizing for? 
For being so incredibly cruel toward you...
I was misinformed and treated you quite poorly. I'm ashamed of myself...
That's what's bothering you? It's really okay, honestly.
So you say, but I cannot forgive myself so easily.
I will regret my actions for as long as I live.
Of course, I will not be able to refuse if you tell me to do so...
I firmly believe I should be punished! Yes, I{W:700} must{W:0} be punished!
C'mon, you're taking this too seriously... 
I knew my efforts were in vain no matter how many times I tried to reassure her.
If we continued this conversation, she may actually feel this way for the rest of her life.
What kind of punishment, then?
I am not in the position to make that sort of judgment call.
Yeah, I figured she'd say as much...
She wouldn't be convinced if I were to propose a punishment that was too soft.
Gotcha. In that case...
