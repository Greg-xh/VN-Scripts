Haa, haa... I'm sorry for being late!
Woof, woof!
Hana-san! J-Jeez, what happened?! We were worried sick about you!
Quite true, but we forgot about her until just now.
I greatly apologize for worrying you. I'll... forget that part about forgetting me, though...
The thing is, Romeo...
Muuau...
Hana worriedly turned toward Romeo, who then curled up apologetically.
I took him out for a walk as soon as I woke up, but he was so enthusiastic we ended up going to the next town over. 
I'm not familiar with Tokyo, or the local area, so I thought I'd rely on Romeo's sense of direction...
An hour passed, then two more, and we didn't seem to be getting any closer to home. If anything, our surroundings were even less familiar... Haa...
Maybe... Romeo was trying to show you around? He's familiar with the area and wanted you to get to know it, as his partner.
Woof, woof!
He seems to agree! Patches showed me around his territory, too.
Woof!
Romeo's territory is much larger than Patches'. Starting tomorrow, I'll try to take the initiative during our trips!
Woof!
Great! Now that Hana-san's here, Michiyo-san will be in charge of lunch today! Don't let Onii-chan beat you!
Leave it to me. It's a duel, Yanushi. 
Yup, bring it on!
Hana-san, you're in charge of teatime's dessert. Good luck!
Ohoh! Leave it in my capable hands. I'll put my all into doing a lovely job. Who's in charge of teatime in the Kitty Parlor?
Nekodomari-san. 
Oh, Makoto...? Now that's an interesting development. Makoto, I'll have you crying 'fiddlesticks' in frustration!
"Fiddlesticks."
There, I said it. What do I win? "Fiddlesticks," though? Are you from the stone age, Hana? Heehee.
Meow, meow!
Grrrrrrrrrrrrrr! Are you saying I'm from the stone age?! And you don't win anything!
Western confections are my area of expertise! My store will be filled the brim with customers by lunchtime and leave yours in the dust!
Come, Inukai-san and Inuyama-san. We have preparations to make.
Yeah, let's go. I'll see you later, Onii-chan.
Let's get going, too. Kenta-kun, Makoto-chan, Hinana-chan, let's work hard!
Yes!
...
Meow~?
Makoto looks like she's in a bad mood...
