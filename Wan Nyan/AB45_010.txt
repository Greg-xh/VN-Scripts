I now had a wonderful girlfriend, and that was something worth more than any amount of fame or money.
I thought I would set out to master all kinds of sweet-making techniques to create the Ultimate Sweet.
However, I was wrong. Having someone to call my sweetheart enriched my life more than anything, and making sweets every day only made it that much more fulfilling.
My creativity overflowed, almost like someone had cast a spell on me, and I felt more accomplished than ever before. I'd often lose track of time because of it.
And, before I noticed it, the final day of the exam was upon me.
