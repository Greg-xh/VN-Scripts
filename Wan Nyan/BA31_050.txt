Thanks to Nee-san, I narrowed it down to the dorms. My mission was to now search this place top to bottom.
First, let's start with the storeroom.
Oh, Yanushi-kun. 
Hey there. Restocking?
Yes. We've been using a lot of ingredients recently, so I've been coming here regularly.
Great to hear business is booming.
It's satisfying seeing our business grow, but a touch disheartening to know it will only last during the exam.
Yeah, I feel the same way. Anyway, that looks heavy. Do you need a hand?
Thank you. It's not that heavy, though. I'll be fine.
All right. If you need anything, don't hesitate to tell me.
Speaking of, what brought you here? 
Oh, right! Have you seen that cat the chairwoman was talking about?
Ah, the missing one? I've been here for a while now, but haven't heard so much as a meow.
No dice, then.
No matter how lazy it was, it was still an animal and it had no reason to stay in one place. Maybe I missed it?
...May I ask you a question?
Huh? Yeah, sure.
You may have been asked this already... But I still need to know.
How do you feel about Makoto? 
I think she's a talented p｡tissi｢re.
Not like that. How do you feel about her as a girl?
As a girl? Well, she's cute and attractive.
...
Hmm? Did I say something wrong?
What about me? Do you think I'm cute, too?
Of course you are, Hana.
...I find that hard to believe. 
I'm serious!
Actions speak louder than words...
I'm heading out now. Sorry for interrupting your work.
Good luck.
Thanks.
