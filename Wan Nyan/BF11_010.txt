All right, let's go with this!
Um, one?
Is that right? 
Oh! Are you my partner, Hana?
It seems so.
Cool, let's have fun! 
I'm no good at this sort of thing, but I hope we will!
Hehe, you must be{W:700} quite{W:0} jealous, Makoto!
Where are you coming up with this stuff...? I'm not jealous at all.
It's unbecoming for a lady to lie!
Again, where are you getting this from? Nothing I've said has been a lie.
No matter who he teams up with, Kenta will eventually end up with me. Nothing is going to change that.
Where is that baseless confidence of yours coming from?!
It's a proven fact.
Let's hear it, then. What is the basis for your argument?
Because I said it would.
Perhaps I should ask you the same thing: Where is this nonsense coming from? That's nothing more than wishful thinking.
Call it whatever you want.
I swear, you've always been so... 
If everyone's done partnering up, then team one should go first.
Ready to go? 
Yes, of course.
