Hmm... All right, how about this...?
I stayed behind after the store closed.
Senpai warned me to not work myself too hard and headed back the dorms, but I honestly felt fine. 
I reassured her I wasn't overworking myself and promised to get some rest, but stayed behind at the store anyway.
Once again, I focused all of my attention on my new cake. I knew I had to head back and sleep eventually, but I didn't feel the slightest bit tired.
Michiyo-san's sweets... 
I was contemplating what sweets best fit Michiyo-san's image.
This was the most challenging and intensive training I'd ever endured. It required unwavering concentration, imagination, and a myriad of other skills.
(What is this, though...? I don't remember ever being this focused on something before... A sweet made in another person's image, huh...?)
I had surprised myself.
Up until now, I was content with making sweets that satisfied my own standards.
I'd try to give my random ideas shape and polish them however I could. I figured that was good enough...
But now, for the first time, I wasn't making something for myself or a customer... but for the person I cherished most.
I wanted to make her happy, in the simplest, truest way possible.
Despite how anxious I felt, I was excited and had a lot of fun making it.
Not only did I want the girl I love to smile, but I wanted to make her happy, too.
Michiyo-san... 
Those feelings propelled me forward and my hands continued to work their magic.
