And so, another day came to an end. Thanks to the cat-searching incident, I was more tired than usual.
The chairwoman had to be pretty overprotective to declare the cat missing after a day.
Hopefully this was the last time that happens.
Yanushi. 
Oh, hi. Are you finished with work? 
Yes. Are you perhaps free after this?
I've got nothing to do, so sure. 
Can we take a walk right now?
That's unusual... But I won't give up on the chance to become better friends with her!
Of course, I'll gladly accompany you.
I... I see.
It may seem like an odd request given I'm the one who invited you, but I'm not familiar with the area. Can you choose where we go?
Of course, I'll gladly you show you my favorite routes for a walk. 
Let's go, then.
Right!
We're here. Let's take a break.
A-All right... 
It's rather chilly. It's hard to believe how hot it was earlier.
Weren't you surprised when you first came here? Like, damn, how is it so hot?
Yes...
Mmm? Michiyo-san?
...What?
Are you shivering?
Pay it no mind... 
You can say that all you want, I'll still worry.
Kyaaaaa!
The wind shook the trees, is all.
I... I see.
I guess this route wasn't the best choice. The park can be pretty creepy at this time of night.
You should have said something. 
I didn't have the right to object, since I asked you to select our destination...
That's not a good reason... You're so serious about everything.
Anyway, it's a bit early but do you want to go back?
I can't.
Why not?
The terror has frozen in me place. 
That bad, huh...? That's not good. Wanna talk about something you like?
I'd heard human warmth can have a relaxing effect on the nerves...
I've heard that, too. What about it?
You should... hold me close.
...Michiyo-san?
