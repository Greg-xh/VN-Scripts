Three cakes of the day, yes? Understood.
It's amazing, Onii-chan! Our cake is selling so well!
The customers that just left bought seven of them to take home to their friends!
We've mostly focused on cute-looking cakes recently, so maybe it sparked demand for more mature-tasting ones.
Considering the store's theme, it might've been a bit more mature than our target audience. I can see how that would happen.
I'm glad everyone likes it. 
Same here. Seeing how happy you are is the best part, though.
Hehe, I really am happy.
Business is booming, I see. 
How long have you been here, Nee-san?
I just got here. I noticed your collaboration cake is now on the menu.
You and everyone else said it's good, so I figured we could. 
Or was that... not a good idea?
How you run the store is up to you. If you all agreed on it, I see no reason to find fault with your choices. 
Besides, how could I possibly complain with how positive the response has been?
Will your cake be a permanent addition to the menu?
Not sure. We wanted to test the waters first.
Let's do it! Not selling something{W:700} this{W:0} good would be a huge waste!
It{W:700} is{W:0} selling much better than I originally anticipated...
Yeah. We're gonna sell out soon if we don't make more, too.
It's worth considering, then... Let's ask the others later.
Since this was your idea from the start, we should write down the recipe so you'll be able to make it when I'm not here.
Or you could just stay here the whole time!
You can decide what to do later. The customer at table seven is calling for you.
Ah! I'll go! I'll be right over!
I'll be heading back, then. Don't let down your guard until the last customer leaves.
Of course!
Well, then... Let's go make more of that cake!
