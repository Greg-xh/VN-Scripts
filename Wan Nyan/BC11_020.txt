It's really quiet. 
I welcome the silence, as it lets me savor the brief date we've found ourselves on.
Man, it really does feel like something could pop out at any second.
Like what? Don't tell me you believe in ghosts. 
What else could it possibly be in this situation?
A burglar trying to steal high-quality cookware, or a valuable recipe book? 
It's scary to think how realistic that sounds!
Is it? I'm not scared in the slightest, though.
How are you so calm?
Wouldn't you protect me if a burglar{W:700} did{W:0} show up?
Huh, you're putting this on me? I have to face-off with a burglar?
I'm not saying you need to fight him head-on. I just meant I'd be fine so long as I'm with you.
That's some trust you've got there... 
Of course. You're my one and only, after all.
It's kind of awkward when you put it that way.
If you find{W:700} this{W:0} awkward, then you're gonna have trouble dealing with what I've got in store for you next.
Ahaha...
Time really does fly by when you have fun. We're already at the classroom. 
Looks like it. Let's go in.
There's something written on the blackboard. 
Let's see... We're supposed to take a cookie from the jar on that desk, and head to the dining hall using a different route than before.
All right... Well, let's grab a cookie, then.
Sure, and we'll enjoy the rest of our date.
