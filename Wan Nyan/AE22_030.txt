Hurray! That was great!
Yeah, it worked out even better than I imagined.
Indeed, I did not think the other customers would crowd around you like that. 
That just shows how charming her cake was.
Everyone started watching and asking what kind of cake it was the second we brought it out.
Not only did you fulfill their request, but you also improved our store's reputation.
It all ended splendidly. 
If this spreads, we may receive even more special order requests. 
I'll make the next one! We can't let Inukai-san hog all the limelight, after all!
I agree! I want to make one, too!
That's enough. All will be decided by seniority. I'll be the next in line.
Claiming seniority is just anachronism, if you ask me.
Yeah, you should just let me do it next.
How is that a fair compromise, you fool?
What are all of you bickering about?
Nee-san.
"Sensei."
That aside, I saw everything that happened with that customer just now.
You were in the store?!
By chance, but I was fortunate enough to see something very unusual...
Wh-What did you think, Onee-chan? 
Their reaction said it all. There's not one bad thing I can say after you made them smile like that.
So... I did good?
Genuinely delicious sweets bring people joy, and that happiness affects those around them.
Your cake was a prime example of that. You've done a wonderful job, and are worthy of the PochiTama P｡tissier Academy name.
Well-deserved praise, I'd say. 
Anyone could see the hard work you put in.
You should be proud of yourself, but the store's still open. Brace yourselves for the rest of the day.
Yes!
I'll return to the office, then.
Let's get back to work!
I'm invincible right now!
Ahaha. That sounds promising.
Just leave it to me!
