You were so rough, Kenta-kun...
I'm sorry. You just felt really good, Senpai.
It's embarrassing when you say stuff like that... But I want you to get to know me better...
I'd like that, Senpai. I'll think about you even more, too.
In that case, inviting you to have sex with me was worth the embarrassment.
You were that embarrassed, huh?
O-Of course I was! A girl can't just say something like that!
Thank you for doing all this for me.
You're wrong... I did it for me.
Oh, look at the time! Our morning briefing is about to start!
The time really flew by... Let's go, then.
Yeah, let's work real hard today!
