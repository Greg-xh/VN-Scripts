How was it?
Hana sat upright while I, still exhausted from what we'd just done, laid back and basked in the afterglow.
Yeah... It was good...
Hana proudly puffed out her chest upon hearing my earnest reply.
Heheh... Wasn't it, though?!
She hummed smugly. 
Makoto never does this for you, does she?
Huh...?
Yanushi-kun... I can do this for you whenever you want! 
Ah... Ahahaha... 
Even now, Hana maintained her usual rivalry with Makoto.
She's a handful, for sure, but... 
Makoto had Hana beat in terms of raw, culinary talent. However, when it came to sex, Hana certainly had the upper hand... or so she probably thought.
When I considered that, I couldn't help but find her adorable.
Hana....
Before I could fully register what I was doing, I found myself embracing Hana.
Huh...?
You're doing great, Hana. Both as a p｡tissi｢re and as a girl... 
Huh? What?!
Hana shrugged me off and jumped back.
What...?
D-Did she reject me?! I-I'm a little shocked here...
P-Please don't say weird things like that! 
Hana turned red like a tomato. 
D-Don't you get it, Yanushi-kun? You belong to{W:700} me{W:0}!
She pointed her index finger at me, almost like I was picking a fight with her.
Are we clear? I will never accept you belonging to Makoto!
And with that as her parting remark, Hana left.
Ahaha....
I really wanted them to be friends...
And I thought they could get along well, too...
But if they had feelings for me, then that was at least one point they could agree on.
I was the reason for their animosity, though...
That night, my mind was plagued with thoughts of those two girls and I couldn't sleep a wink...
