You're making pound cake?
It's an orthodox dessert, but we don't have it on our menu.
It has a nice color to it. I can tell how yummy it is just by looking at it. This aroma... is that black tea?
To make a pound cake with black tea, you simply knead the tea leaves into the dough.
That sounds great. The smell lingers in your nostrils and leaves a great aftertaste in your mouth.
Dishing out reviews, and you haven't even tried it yet.
As I said before, I can tell how good something is just by looking at it.
I appreciate the compliment, but it's not good enough.
Why? You didn't mess anything up. 
Yes, but it's still not good enough.
It doesn't feel like something{W:700} I{W:0} would make. I have to add some twist to it.
You're so meticulous.
Obviously. Making something that tastes good is not enough. It needs to show my individuality as an artisan.
I see... Do you mind if I watch until you're done?
Of course not.

Makoto fell silent, enthusiastically concentrating on making sweets. 
Now that we were finally alone, I thought we could have sex to spice things up. Makoto, on the other hand, seemed far more interested in baking than to notice me.
Seeing how laser-focused she was was nice in itself, though.
Kenta...
Are you thinking about something perverted?
I'm not! Not at all!
Really...?
Damn, she saw right through me. I tried to keep my lewd thoughts at bay, so as not to disturb her.
These ingredients aren't enough... I know! That will work!
Suddenly, Makoto added even more ingredients to the dish and resumed working. I couldn't help but admire how delicate and wonderful her movements were.
She really was a genius. I sat back and watched her work.
