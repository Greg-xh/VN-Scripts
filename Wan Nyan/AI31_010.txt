Hmm... It's been so busy lately...
I had the day off, but it didn't feel like it given how busy things had been over the last few days.
Which was why I didn't have a clue as to how to spend what little free time I actually had.
(What should I do...? Maybe going for a walk would be a nice change of pace. I'll get some tea from a nice store, and study for a bit...)
(I'll relax, unwind, and study for a bit. Sounds like the best way to spend a day off...)
Ah, Onii-chan! Where are you off to?
Yo, Nono. What about you, where are you heading off to?
I bumped into Nono out in the hallway, who seemed to have a lot of free time on her hands.
Me? Well... I wasn't going anywhere in particular, um... How about you, Onii-chan?
Oh, I just figured I'd go take a walk or something... Wanna join me, if you've got nothing else to do?
Huh, a walk? I'll join you! Sounds like both of us were pretty bored, huh? Hehe...
Everyone else had errands to run today, so I had no one to hang out with...
Ahaha, so you were just wandering around with nothing to do... Well, that's fine. Let's go.
Mhm, let's go! Going on a walk with Onii-chan! We haven't done this in forever, ahaha...
I was bored, so going on a walk with Nono might be nice and we could reminisce about our childhood.
