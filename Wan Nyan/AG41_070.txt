Okay, let's do this...!
I stepped into the kitchen and pumped my fists enthusiastically.
The only thing I knew how to do was make sweets. It was both my forte and greatest weapon...!
If I were to harness all of my overwhelming emotions, I could create the Ultimate Sweet...!
Would that make it the Ultimate Sweet, though? Ahaha... Well, I'd better go above and beyond in order to make it into a reality.
There were many ways I could further motivate myself, by motivating others, competing in a contest, or satisfying the customers' culinary needs. However, in that moment, my heart was lit ablaze.
(I'll put all of my feelings into it to make something truly incredible... I'll make it to express my feelings...!)
I'd never made sweets with this particular goal in mind, but that only motivated me more.
All right, let's do this...!
I'd express my feelings to the fullest, and ensure they would reach her.
Now that my heart felt full, I poured all of my efforts into turning the ingredients before me into the Ultimate Sweet...
