Good night. Take care... Oh, right, your room is right there.
Yeah, good night. Thank you for going on a walk with me.
Don't mention it; it was a good change of pace. I think I'll be able to sleep well tonight. 
That's good. I'll see you tomorrow, then.
Yeah, see you. Good night, Michiyo-san. 
Good night, Yanushi. Let's work hard tomorrow, too... 
...
We returned to the dorms, and I watched Michiyo-san walk back to her room. I turned around as soon as she was out of sight.
I couldn't go to bed just yet, and my bath would have to wait until later. I had work to consider, but I had a little bit of time to spare. I'd have to do this as fast as I could...!
