I need to use the bathroom, so I'll head in first.
By all means.
All right, time to answer nature's call.
Phew! They don't call it "relieving yourself" for nothing.
Good job today, Kenta-kun.
Right back at you, Senpai. Are you on the way to the bathroom, too?
You can't ask a girl something like that. That's sexual harassment, you know?
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean it like that. 
Yeah, I know. You're not like that. 
Any other girl, especially one you don't know very well, might've taken it differently.
I'll be more careful going forward.
That's good. 
Ahaha.
Heehee... 
I didn't come here to use the bathroom, though. I need to head home to take care of some stuff.
Right{W:700} now{W:0}?
Yeah, even at this hour.
I'll join you, then.
Huh? All the way to my house? You don't have to. I'm sure you're exhausted.
Come on, don't be so modest. It's just us, Senpai.
...What kind of relationship do you think we have, exactly?
One between an underclassman and his senpai, of course.
Haah... I thought you'd say that. I really should lower my expectations...
Expectations?
Forget it. It'll just make me feel bad.
I've said this before, but it's dangerous for a girl to walk outside alone at this time of night.
Who knows what might happen, so I'll protect you!
You're such a worrywort. 
It's better to be cautious than have the rug pulled out from under you! As they say, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
Would it be a bad thing if I came along? I'll back off if that's a problem.
It's not a big deal. I'm happy to have you.
I can join you, then?
Yeah, please do. Keep me safe, okay?
I'll protect you, even if it costs my life!
You don't have to go that far!
That's how determined I am! 
I'll take you at your word and leave it at that.
Yup, you can count on me!
Haha. I'll wait for you to change out of your uniform, then.
I'd hate for you to wait for me, so I'll go as-is.
You don't have to do that.
It's okay! Let's head out.
Well, all right. Thank you.
