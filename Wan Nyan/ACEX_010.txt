Nn, nnn... Morning already? It's my turn to make breakfast, too... Nnn, but gotta turn off the alarm first...  Ah.
O-Ouch... 
Rolling out of bed is pretty bad, even for someone who's as bad at waking up as I was.
I figured I'd have plenty of time to make breakfast this way.
How clumsy. I can't believe you fell off the bed trying to turn off your alarm clock. You're nothing but a clumsy, clumsy boy.
Stop calling me that. Everyone messes up sometimes.
Not me. You're like an uncoordinated cat who can't get by without me, Kenta. Should I come and sleep with you tonight?
Don't. I can sleep just fine by myself.
Are you being a contrarian, darling?
I'm not.
Anyway, I've gotta start making breakfast. It's my turn today, after all.
...You really are clumsy. 
Why?
Well, why do you think I'm standing here making tofu and miso soup?
Well...
Of course, I got the soybeans for the miso from the pot over there, and I made the tofu fresh this morning. This is the famous brand of hot rice, cooked traditional-style in an earthenware pot.
I used Ariake-made nori for the rice balls, added extra love in your share, and even made them bite-sized. Get it now?
So, in other words...
It's my turn to make breakfast today, not yours. Your turn is tomorrow.
Aaaaaaaah!
You clumsy boy. That just makes you cuter, though.
Being called "cute" by a girl doesn't make me happy. O-O-Ouch... It still hurts where I fell earlier.
