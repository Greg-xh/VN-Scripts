Are you sure you're okay? You still look kind of dizzy...
I'm fine. It's still hot inside, and it feels like something's stuck in there... You haven't pulled out yet, right?
O-Of course not! It'd be crazy if I did... 
Heh heh, that's right. It belongs to both of us now.
Huh?!
It belongs to both of us! I belong to you, and you belong to me, right? So{W:700} that{W:0} belongs to me, too.
Is that how it works?
Or is there someone else? Are you cheating on me, Kenta?
No, that's not what I--No, I don't think I am.
Hehe. I'm devoted to you, and only you. You're my one and only, both at love and making sweets.
So... please stay with me.
Mhm. I may not be worth much, but I hope we can get to know each other better.
Mhm. I hope for the same. After all, one of my dreams just came true.
Dream?
Yeah. I intend to work hard to see it through to the end. I became your lover... and will eventually become your bride!
My what?!
I'll make sure it happens. With how thick headed a certain someone can be, just having sex doesn't feel like it'll be enough... I've got too many rivals.
Huh... Rivals?
Forget it. Explaining it will just complicate things... Maybe you being dense isn't so bad.
...?
I have another dream, though. It's to become the best confectionery artisan in the world.
That's one dream I won't give up on, either!
Yes, let's push each other to new heights. We can definitely do it. 
Yeah. 
...
Good night, Kenta. Or, maybe I should call you "Darling" now...?
No, Kenta's fine.
Heehee. Good night, I love you. Muha!
Ah... 
Without warning, Makoto gave me a quick peck on the cheek and stepped out into the hall with a naughty smile slapped across her face.
Such a simple gesture made me want to chase after Makoto and pull her into a tight embrace...
Nah, I can't... She's sharing a room with the others, after all.
Guess I'm sleeping alone tonight.
Damn, though... Makoto was really cute. Ahaha.
Was that Makoto? She was coming out of Yanushi-kun's room... Based on what he said before...
Huuuh?! Th-This is not only harrowing, but indecent, too!
Not just that, but I... I like Yanushi-kun, too...! Makoto, you cut ahead of me again! Uuugh!
I could hear someone throwing a fit outside my bedroom door, but I was too tired and fell asleep instead.
The sheets smelled of her, lulling me into Makoto-induced dreams.
