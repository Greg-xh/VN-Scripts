Onii-chan, you've been staying up really late to work on cakes recently...
Are you all right? You{W:700} are{W:0} getting enough sleep, right?
That's right. Your body won't last if you don't rest properly.
When I entered the shop, I was suddenly surrounded. 
They found out I'd been staying up late recently to work, which was interfering with my sleep schedule.
I suppose word got out after I bumped into the chairwoman and Senpai scolded me for it. 
It's fine, I'll make sure to get some proper sleep starting tonight. I got some rest yesterday, so it shouldn't get in the way of work.
Huh? It'll be fine starting tonight? 
You'll get proper sleep starting tonight? So that means... 
...Does that mean the project you're working on will be finished this evening, then?
Yeah, that's right. I guess I ended up stressing you guys out...
I gave Michiyo-san a firm nod and looked around at everyone's smiles.
Oh my, it's almost complete? What are you making, and when will you show it to us? I'm looking forward to seeing it. 
Nah, there's no unveiling date. I made the cake for myself... I'm not putting it up for sale, but giving it to someone special.
Whaaat, I wanna see it! C'mon, you can even show me a picture of it! I wanna see it!
H-Hmm... W-Well, maybe later, once I've finished polishing it up.
Anyway, it's almost time to open. Let's get to work!
I never claimed I would or wouldn't show off the cake, so there was no reason to further antagonize Nono over it.
I got to work before things could escalate further. It was almost time to open, and we already had a small crowd of people lining up outside.
Yanushi...
Let's go, Michiyo-san. It's another day at Beans Puppy!
Michiyo-san nodded and returned to work with a faint smile.
