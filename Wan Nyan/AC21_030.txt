It was lunchtime.
While it wasn't the main focus of a specialized academy like ours, there were many things one could learn from cooking normal dishes, too.
As a result, it was included in the curriculum and many students worked part-time at shops that served lunch.
I learned a lot from restaurants during my training journey. 
The omelette rice is ready! Are there any other orders? 
That's the last one, thanks! Are you tired, Kenta-kun? We had a lot of customers today and you were in the kitchen alone.
I'm fine. I'm used to staying busy and it just gets the blood pumping. I've trained for this sort of thing, after all.
Wow, amazing. The power of youth...
Youth?
Ah?! No, I didn't mean it like that. I'm only a year older than you, after all. I might be the eldest here, but I'm still young!
Ahaha. I know, Senpai.
You using "Senpai" like that makes me feel old...
Ahaha... 
Senpai was likely at a delicate age. Speaking of, there was someone else here in a delicate state...
Hey, Senpai. Have you seen Makoto?
I'm right behind you.
Huh?! Oh, Makoto. Hmm, now that the lunch rush is over, do you want to take a break?
There are still some panburgers from this morning. We made too many, remember?
And who was the one responsible for making them?
Huh?
Forget it. We still have customers, so I've got stuff to do. You can take your break alone.
Wait, Makoto...! She's gone.
Kenta-kun, did you do something to upset Makoto-chan?
No, nothing. If anything, she's the one who messed with me this morning...
Huh? Messed with you...?
No, nothing. I'll go take my break now. Bye!
Ah, sure...
Did something happen? Mmm, this is suspicious...
