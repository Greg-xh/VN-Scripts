Wh-What... did you just say?!
We'll be doing a test of courage tonight! 
Eek!
O-Oh...? S-So, that was your idea...?
You're shaking, Hana. Are you chickening out before we even start? 
W-Would you care to think before you open that silly mouth of yours?! As if{W:700} I{W:0} would ever chicken out of anything! 
Oh? Well, aren't you dependable?
Wh-Why, of course I am!
Wow! That sounds like it'll be fun and exciting!
It so totally doesn't... 
I believe I'll retire... 
Huh? You're not playing along? We're hanging out together so we can become better friends.
There are a plethora of other ways to do just that.
Are you scared of ghosts, perhaps?
I consider anyone who's fond of them to be a madman. 
When she was little, Nono used to be afraid to ghosts, too.
Th-That's old news! I'm perfectly fine now!
You look terrified right now, though...
Not at all! I'm fine, so stop treating me like a kid!
No worries. I called it a "test of courage," but there aren't any jumpscares.
...Is that so?
Mhm! Just head to classroom 3-A, grab the thing I put on my desk, and come back here.
We'll have to go to the campus for this test of courage?
On campus at nighttime... It's far too daunting!
Those kinds of things don't exist, so there's nothing to be scared of.
You're not qualified to make such claims.
Are you not going to do it, then?
...I won't be selfish and make a fuss about it. 
As diligent as ever. 
It is far preferable to being a slacker. 
I'll continue, then. This test of courage will be in groups of two.
We'll draw straws, and you'll partner up with whoever has the same number.
There will be a group of three since there's an uneven number of people, but that's that.
Any questions? 
I think it's fine. 
All right! Let's draw straws.
Y-Yeah. 
My partner, huh...? Who should I pair up with...?
