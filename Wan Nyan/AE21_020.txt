All cleaned up!
The dogs are secured in their cages, too.
I'm done locking up, so that just leaves Hana...
There were a lot of customers today, huh?
It got pretty crazy as the day went on. Maybe it's because we changed up the menu?
I'd imagine so.
I'm really happy so many people came here just to eat our sweets!
Us artisans thrive on their praise.
Oh, right. You got held up at table eight earlier. Did something happen?
Ah, yeah! They asked if we could make them something special.
Something special?
Sounds like I missed something interesting. What are you talking about?
They wanted to bring their dog-loving friend here to celebrate her birthday!
And they asked if it would be possible to bake a surprise birthday cake for her.
Oh... 
That sounds lovely. I'm sure their friend would be thrilled.
What did you tell them?
I told them I'd make the best birthday cake ever! I'm sorry, I should've said something sooner.
You have nothing to apologize for. I would have done the same.
No reason to refuse their request. It was a wise decision.
I agree. You just responded to their request.
Does that mean it's okay to make them the birthday cake?
You already agreed to do it, so I don't see why not.
Precisely. Now that you're in this position, be sure to put your all into it.
Yup, yup! Remember, the other customers will be watching you, too.
Don't hesitate to ask us if you need any help.
Thank you!
And it took me a while, but I'm done with everything, too.
All right, let's head back.
Yes.
I'm going to stay behind for a bit. I want some time to come up with a design for the birthday cake.
Very well. Don't forget you have to work tomorrow and overdo it.
I won't! 
I'm off, Nono. 
Okay! Good night!
