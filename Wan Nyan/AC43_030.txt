The cake shop we found downtown earlier was simply lovely.
Their cakes were shaped like bears and rabbits, and they even had some delectable and traditional-looking cakes made with oranges.
Oh, that's the one you had me try. That orange cake was great.
And there was that pudding that used egg shells. Nekojou-san ate the whole thing...
Jeez. Does Hina have a black hole for a stomach?
She must! Hehehe, ahaha!
Hana was visibly nervous after leaving the dorms and on our way to the park.
She went back to normal once we got to the park though. We started chatting about the cake she bought, and got all excited over some new pastry she found.
Woof, woof!
Hmm? What is it, Romeo?
Woof! 
Yes, I understand. I leave it to you, Romeo-san. 
Woof!
With that single response, Romeo rushed into the bushes.
Is that okay?
Not to worry, he's smart. He's well aware that some people are afraid of seeing a big dog walking around alone.
He never leaves my side when there are people around because of it.
Really? Romeo's incredible. 
Yes, he's a wonderful dog. He picked up on how I felt and wanted to give us some alone time.
...?
Never mind that. Let's walk a while longer, Yanushi-kun. 
Yeah.
This is Dock 2, the target is on the move. Do you read, Dock 1?
Yes, yes. I read you loud and clear. Go ahead, Dock 2.
...Wait, you're right next to me. 
I mean, I{W:700} was{W:0} worried about Onii-chan... But if I follow him like this, I might end up missing something important.
Something important?
Yup! I'm dying to see it!
You're here, too, Nekojou?
Yup, and so is Mako-chan...
...Wait, where is she?!
Wait, now's not the time to chit-chat. Let's get to stalking! 
We're not stalking, we're{W:700} tailing.{W:0}
Woof!
Mmm, it's Romeo. What's he doing here...?
Woof! Woof, woof! 
Woof? Woof, woof?
Woof, woof, woof?
Meow~?
Woof, woof, woof! Woooooof! 
Woof?! 
Wooof?!
Meow?!
Woof, woof, woof!
Wh-What's wrong, Chihuaboy? Why are you being so loud?
Woof, woof, woof!
You too, Patches. Don't bark...!
Meow~! Meoooow~!
Daifuku's being loud, too. We can't follow them like this.
Woof! Woof! Wooof!
Woof! Woof woof! 
Meow, meeeoow~! 
Cut that out, you guys. What's gotten into you?
Woof~!
Why do I feel like Romeo's eyes are trying to say, "I'm forever in your debt, friends"?
Yes, it's also saying, "My master is in a once-in-a-lifetime battle right now."
I see. I don't quite understand, but you're doing it for a friend, right? You've truly matured, Chiahuaboy.
Woof~!
That's real friendship! I'm proud of you, Patches!
We can't follow them like this, though... Ah! Forget that, we've already lost them!
Shinono & Michiyo
Ah...
