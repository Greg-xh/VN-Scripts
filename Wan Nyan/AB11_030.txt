I closed the cash register. 
Looks like we're done for the day.
Good job, everyone!
Phew, we sure worked our butts off today. 
Oh, and how were our sales today?
They're not bad. We actually did quite well.
Really?! We did have a lot of customers today. 
The cake Kenta made sold like, well, hot cakes!
Leave it to Ken-chan!
From what I saw, Makoto's cake was pretty popular too. 
It still wasn't enough to overtake yours. I can't help but praise your skill, but it's a bit frustrating at the same time. 
Hehe. You're both amazing.
So true. We can't give up, either!
Yes!
I'm really glad you came here, Kenta-kun. You've done all the heavy lifting and helped with sales.
Yup, yup! It's great having him around.
You should keep working here until the exam ends. It'll be better for you, too, Kenta.
Rather than going back and forth, you should just settle down here and focus on making pastries.
That's a great idea, Mako-chan! You're always so smart. 
I'd also like it if you stayed, but you don't want to be tied down to one place, right?
You want to meet and learn from all kinds of different people.
That's exactly it, Senpai.
It makes me happy to know I'm needed, but I want to learn everything I can and I've got a long way to go before I get there.
I understand that perfectly. What I'm also saying is, I want you to stay by my side.
You're not dense enough to miss what I'm trying to say here, right? 
Um...
Ah! That's not fair, Mako-chan! Ken-chan belongs to all of us!
Nngh! Hina, if you hug me too tight, I'll...
Does it feel good?
Your breasts are smothering me...! I can't breathe...!
If boobs are what kills you, then it'll be mine that do it. Come here, I'll kill you softly.
No, no! You can't kill him!
Mmm! Ken-chan's just so huggable! Let's smell you! Sniff, sniff...
Don't do that! I'm all sweaty!
I like how you smell! Sniff, sniff.
You're so weird.
Don't hog him all to yourself. I want to feel Kenta, too. 
Help! I'm stuck between a boob and a soft place! 
Heheh. Bask in the glory of my softness.
C-Can't breathe! But it's soft and smells so good...!
You two are awfully assertive...
Of course we are. There's no reason to hold back.
That's right! You shouldn't deny yourself of what you really want.
You two are after Kenta-kun, too...?
Let me go already! I'm getting crushed!
