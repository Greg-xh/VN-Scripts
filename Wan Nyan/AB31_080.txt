Koro-chan's been gone for a while.
I wonder if something happened?
Mhm... I'm a little worried.
I didn't mean to concern you guys. 
Oh, Senpai. 
Oh, why did you change out of your uniform?
I'll explain everything later, but there's something urgent I have to take care of first.
Really?
Mhm. I'm sorry for leaving when we were so busy.
We'll have Kenta take over for you, so don't worry about it.
B-Bring it on.
We'll be fine, so you can go without worrying about us. Aren't you in a hurry?
Thanks, guys... I'll be off, then. 
Good luck! 
I'm a bit worried about Korone-san, but let's focus on work for the time being.
Yeah, you're right.
