That night, Hana and I sat on the bench together in the park.
It was the same bench we sat on during our first date.
Haa...
What's wrong? You've been spacing out all day today.
It just... feels like I'm dreaming.
More like daydreaming. You accidentally dropped three plates today, too.
Ugh...
I was at a loss for words.
...But can you blame me? That offer came out of nowhere. 
It's a good thing, though. Like Inuyama-san said, it means your efforts have been officially recognized.
No... Of course I'm happy. But... 
But?
Don't make me say it... If I leave to train at Lueur des ｦtoiles, then we...
...
We just started going out, but we'd have to say goodbye for at least three years...
Hana suddenly stood up. 
What are you saying, Yanushi-kun?!
She crossed her arms and looked down at me with bared teeth.
You can't refuse such a great offer! You have to take it!
But... 
But what?
What about our promise...?
I refuse to be the reason you don't take this offer. It'll make me look like the kind of bothersome woman who's just holding you back!
That's not...!
If you truly care about me, take the offer and go.
But...
I... You said you'd come back for me after I went home to Kyoto, right?
Th-That's why... I have to keep that promise.
Hana huffed indignantly, as if to stop me from saying anything further. 
Having... a gentleman come for you is a charming prospect, but... I think chasing after you is much more fitting.
Hana... 
Before I knew it, I rose to my feet.
Despite the bold look on her face, Hana seemed so small and unreliable.
And yet, her sharp glare and crossed arms sought to overpower me.
I found myself wrapping my arms around my cheeky lover.
...?!
I'll wait for you... I'll always be waiting for you to come to me.
Hana smiled at my profession.
Yes...
Hana nodded with a grin, stood on her tiptoes, and brought her lips to mine...
Mm...
We shared a long, deep kiss, almost like we were dreading to ever part from one another...
