Aaah?!
Ah...?! Wh-What is this...?!
When the door opened, Senpai cried out in surprise.
Aaaah... I'm... kind of dizzy...!
Ah, Hina?!
I caught Hina in mid-air, who had almost lost her balance and fell backwards.
Is someone drinking in here?
Per Makoto's question, the office absolutely reeked of booze.
My apologies, I tried to air out the room, but... 
Inside, Nee-san sat behind her desk and browsed an assortment of documents, and... Aaah?!
Zzz... 
PochiTama's esteemed chairwoman was sleeping soundly under her desk.
How much did the chairwoman have to drink...?
During today's meeting, our staff complained about her laziness directly.
It's pointless to complain about it now...
Does that mean she drowned her frustrations in alcohol?
Yes, something along those lines. 
...What do we do, then?
She blacked out a while ago, so just let her sleep.
Um... Is that really okay?
It's not... If we took her home now, there's a good chance she won't show up tomorrow. It's better to leave her here.
What a... disappointing chairwoman... 
She wasn't so much a disappointing{W:700} chairwoman{W:0} as she was a disappointing{W:700} adult{W:0}.
Nee-san sighed, her eyes still fixed on her paperwork.
