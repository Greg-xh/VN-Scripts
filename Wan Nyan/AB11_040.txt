Good work today, Yanushi-kun. 
Right back at you. Are you done for the day, too?
No, I'm staying behind for a bit. The others already went back, though.
No greetings for us, Hana?
Was your work good enough to receive such praise?
And what about yours?
Of course. I gave it everything I've got.
You'll burnout fast if you keep that up. Working hard doesn't always produce perfect results.
Are you implying that{W:700} you{W:0} did better than me?
Our customers will be the judge of that. Boasting how hard you worked is nothing more than a self-satisfied pat on the back, and you won't get better.
That's not it at all! I have more to learn before I can claim to be perfect.
I see. Be sure to work on that.
Ugh! Your patronizing tone drives me up the wall!
I'm surprised you can work in the same shop as this vile woman, Yanushi-kun! Starting tomorrow, you should stay and work with me at Beans Puppy!
Keep your delusions to yourself. 
I could say the same to you!
You two are such good friends. 
How?! 
Hehe! Rather than standing out here, shall we get changed now?
Right. I don't have time for these pointless conversations. 
That's my line!
...
Huh? Aren't you going with them, Senpai?
...Could you come with me for a bit?
Uhh, sure. Where, though? 
Over here. 
Huh? O-Okay.
