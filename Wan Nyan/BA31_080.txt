It wasn't in the storeroom.
Maybe it was in the dining hall, or snuck into one of the rooms?
Looks like I'll have to check them all one by one.
I should probably report my progress first, though.
Excuse me!
Hmm, is she gone? Did she go looking for the cat, too?
Zzz... zzz...
...Snoring?
Mngh, mngh... I can't eat another bite...
That's some textbook level sleeptalking lines... 
I can't believe she pushed this job on me and went to sleep_
Aaaaaaaah!
Ngh, what? You're bein' super loud... and woke me up from my nap.
How was it{W:700} missing{W:0}?! The cat's right there, where it always is!
Huh?
Meooooow.
Wow, it really is! When did ya come back?!
Ugh... There are so many things I could say, but whatever. I'm getting back to work.
Good luck~!
God, what are we gonna do with her?
