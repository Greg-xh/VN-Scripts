The test of courage sure was fun. 
There weren't any tricks, so it was more like a walk.
Still, I feel like I saw all sorts of new sides to everyone.
Micchan is always so cool, but she made such a cute face today... I would've pushed her down for sure if we were alone.
You really like Michiyo-san, don't you?
Yup, I love her! Of course, I love, love, love, love you, too!
Thanks. 
I'm really grateful to Koro-chan for coming up with that fun event.
She's always been the one to keep us together. Which makes sense, she{W:700} is{W:0} the oldest one.
I'm jealous that you have such an amazing friend like her.
What are you saying? We're good friends, too, Hina.
Heheheh, that's right. 
I hope there's an event where we can all have fun and play together next time.
Right? That really was a great idea. I'm still so excited, I can't sit still!
I don't think I'll be able to fall asleep at this rate... What a drag!
Mmm... I know. How about we have sex?
What?
We'll have sex, feel{W:700} real{W:0} good, and conk out super hard!
So, c'mon, let's get busy!
You sure are hyped for this. 
No brakes on the hype train!
Ahaha... Be gentle, then. 
That's my line. Let's treat each other well!
