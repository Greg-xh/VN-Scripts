...
Later, we listlessly snuggled up on the bed.
Given how awkward it was, we remained silent and stared up at the ceiling.
Heheh... 
Suddenly, Rui-san broke into a smile. 
Hm...?
I turned to look at her face, and noticed she was far more smug than I'd ever seen her before.
Wh-What? That's creepy...
U-Um... What's up?
Hehehe... Nothin'. I was just thinkin' I'm officially and completely an adult woman... Hehehe.
I-Is that right?
No... She may have some experience now, but she was still immature in more ways than one.
Fuumin won't be able to talk back to me anymore... Hehehe!
Y-You don't need to make it a contest or anything...
You're Fuumin's cousin, aren't ya? Do ya know how stubborn that woman can get?
Feminine rivalry is scary...
But no, even before that...
She seemed much happier at beating her friend to the punch and no longer being a virgin than the actual act itself.
With that in mind, I replied:
W-Well, it's not that she's stubborn, she's just not flexible enough... 
That doesn't even begin to cover it!
She started grumbling with a cat-like frown, but then fell silent. 
...
And then stared at my face fixedly. 
Hm?
I'm sorry... I'm not... It's not that I'm unhappy that we have this kind of relationship now...
Rui-san replied and timidly averted her gaze.
She looked adorable, but I was terribly embarrassed that she had seen right through me.
Despite how she acted sometimes, she really was an adult woman...
M-Me too... 
I hugged her shoulders gently. 
I'm glad the two of us are... in a relationship...
Mmm... Thanks. 
She puckered her lips and wordlessly begged me to kiss her.
And just as I intended to place my lips over hers...
Nngh...
...?
Ngh, ugh... Ken-ta-kun....!
Eh?
I looked at Rui-san's approaching face from up close... 
Nnn... Uuuugh... 
Her face went from a flushed pink to a pale white within a matter of seconds.
Huh? What...?
Spots of red and white surfaced on her face, with some purple ones here and there. 
I... I feel sick...!
Ah... I guess it's because I poked her stomach after she drank so much?
I hurriedly escorted Rui-san to the toilet.
Guh... Ugh... Nng... Buaaahaaaaaaaaaa~!
She thankfully reached the toilet just as she started to throw up...
