Phew... The floors are mopped. I cleaned the ovens earlier... How's it going for you? If you're not done, I can help.
Haa... I lost again. I can't believe it. 
Muuau...
Whoa... You're still worrying about that?
Beans Puppy sent Hana to help clean our kitchen, but she was virtually useless after the meeting and Romeo was trying desperately to encourage her.
You haven't gotten much cleaning done, have you?
Romeo-chan really is loyal. He's trying so hard to cheer up his mistress... Daifuku here is no slouch when it comes to healing powers, though.
Hina?
I took over for Hana-chan. We'll be done with all the cleaning after you're finished.
Thanks, you're a huge help. 
No, don't mention it. But still... 
Hana-chan really set Mako-chan's competitive nature on fire when she got you to help her, Ken-chan.  
Huh?
The power of Mako-chan's jealousy is scary. You should watch yourself, Ken-chan. 
Sh-She's jealous?!
Isn't she? It seemed that way to me.
She was jealous of your talent at breakfast, and was later fuming during teatime after how well you and Hana-chan got along.
Makoto was jealous... of me?
Make sure to apologize to her tomorrow when you see her! I'm sure it'll all blow over then.
That's the man's job, after all.
Really?
Yup!
I couldn't exactly argue when she said that with such a dazzling smile. She was{W:700} that{W:0} pissed off at me?
Hina's words were oddly convincing, even though it didn't quite make sense.
Phew...
I fell on top of my bed after taking in a long, deep breath. I wasn't at all tired, but I was surprisingly languid.
Going to the girl's room to call Makoto was... a no-go today.
Should I apologize to her tomorrow?
I wasn't sure what I should be apologizing for, though. I spent the day worrying about it, and eventually fell asleep...
