I'm heading out, then.
I'll go with you. Good job today.
Yeah, good work. Make sure to rest up. 
Good work, see you tomorrow! Heheheh~
Good luck, you guys!
I'm looking forward to trying out your new cake, too. 
The shop was now closed for the day and we'd just finished cleaning up. Senpai and Makoto shot us a smile before leaving.
We were now alone in the store together...
Ken-chan! Come on, it's time!
Right. Let's get to it and make that new cake for you, Hina!
The time has come! I'll help, too! Hehe.
We stuck around the shop after it closed, as we still had a self-training and tasting session to do... Or something like that.
Let's get crackin', then! You don't have to stop at one cake, either! Let's work hard and make two, three, or even ten cakes!
That's not making a sample cake. That's more like mass producing them to sell in the store... Haha.
She wasn't all talk, though. As expected, Hina was already preparing to make the cake.
I'll set everything out to make it easier for you to work... I'll also get the flour, sugar, eggs, and the other necessary ingredients...
Having everything ready will simplify things. Hehe, I'll get my hands on that cake much sooner, too!
And so, with my reliable, food-snatching helper at my side, I began working on a new cake.
