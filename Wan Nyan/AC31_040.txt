Makoto, I challenge you to do a duel!
...M'kay.
Why, you're so unenthusiastic! We're responsible for teatime today, so it's time to determine who's truly superior!
There's no point making that determination when it's already obvious. Why are you trying so hard...?
Grrr...! Grrr...! What did you just say?! What is that attitude?! I am not inferior to you in any way! 
Huh...?
She{W:700} is{W:0} inferior in one area... 
Yup.
Yup, yup!
Give her a break...
Be quiet! 
Grrrrrr...!!
Anyway, should I win this time... You must obey a direct order, Makoto!
An order...? I'll have to refuse if this is some weird kink of yours. I don't swing that way.
Kink... Grrr! I do not have that kind of inclination! 
Both of us are girls, but if you were a man...
Eww, you're blushing and fidgeting. That's disgusting. 
I am most certainly not! Either way, this is a duel. Whoever loses must obey a direct order from the other! Are we clear?!
Sure, I don't care... 'Cuz I won't lose.
Grrrr!
Would you two knock it off? We'll be opening up the shop soon.
Ah, good morning, Sensei!
Good morning. You're all here, yes? Who's in charge of lunch, again...?
Yes, it's me! 
I'm also in charge at the Kitty Parlor!
Those are some good, motivated replies, you two.
Makoto and I are in charge of teatime. Sensei, I would look forward to today's service if I were you.
After all, Beans Puppy will certainly win in terms of sales today! Take pride in the store you're supervising. 
That sounds very promising, but it won't be easy for you.
Huh...?
By order of the chairwoman, today's theme is Japanese sweets. That applies to lunchtime as well. Teatime will have a special macha menu.
...Macha?
Yes, all desserts must be served with macha. This is a direct order from the chairwoman...
"I've got it! Let's make today's theme Japanese sweets! The students need a change of pace, too!" 
...Or so she said. Phew, she's such a handful.
Managing the store is a test on its own, so upping the ante and adding a difficult menu isn't a bad idea.
It's not really that, but...
With that said, Inuta... I'm glad to see you're so enthusiastic. Japanese sweets are Nekodomari's area of expertise.
She even worked on some products for her family's renowned Japanese confectionary, Nekonoya. 
I believe she'll be a challenging rival to beat when it comes to Japanese sweets, but you have nothing to lose. I look forward to your endeavors! 
N-Nothing...? Nothing to lose...? 
That concludes our briefing. Everyone, get to work. 
Sensei left the kitchen with those parting words. Everyone got to work and scattered to their respective stations, leaving a perplexed Hana in their wake.
What... What am I going to do? I can make Japanese sweets, but against Makoto...?
Good luck, Hana. 
...Makoto?
I'll think of a good punishment... I mean, order for you. Like one of those game shows on TV... Ehehe, good luck. 
Makoto's grin became that much more cheerful. She really is a prankster... 
She returned to her post and left Hana with a melancholic expression on her face, almost like a prisoner awaiting execution.
Whoaaaaaaa! What do I do?! What should I do?! At this rate, Makoto will order me to do something that will make me unfit for marriage!
Etch this sight into your memory, Inukai. That is what "Reaping what one sows" means. Do not become that kind of adult. 
You're exaggerating. Don't dwell on it too much, Hana-san. 
But, who knows what that bully might make me do...
I know! I know what she'll say! It's an order you can't refuse, no matter how much you want to! It's the kind that binds the mind and body...
A game of master and slave between two girls...! Ah, I hope Mako-chan lets me join in, too...!
Stop that, Hinana-chan... You're drooling. 
...
...Senpai, can I have a minute?
What's up, Kenta-kun?
I know I'm supposed to work at the Kitty Parlor today, but I want to help out at Beans Puppy instead.
Huh?!
I studied Japanese confections at Makoto's shop, so having both of us at the Kitty Parlor feels a little unfair. 
Kenta-kun... 
Okay, I understand. Do what you think is right! I'll explain the situation to Sensei. Is that okay, Shinono-chan? 
Yes, of course! We're happy to have you, Onii-chan. I'll work hard, too!
Sure, leave everything to me. 
...
...Yanushi-kun. 
...Are you coming to Beans Puppy to help me?!
Ohohoho! Now I can win! I'll reduce you to a crying mess, Makoto!  
Don't say that, that's mean. 
Mmgh, mmgh...
Ugh, Makoto? You're kind of grumbling, and giving me the stink-eye.
C-Come on, Makoto. I'm trying to make this fair.
Do you want me to order you around, too?
Huh?
Fine by me. I don't mind you ordering me around. But, if I win, I'll be giving the orders and it'll be sexual!
A sexual... order... Huh?! 
I can't let her win, then! 
Yeah, you've got to beat her!
