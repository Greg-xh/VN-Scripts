Good work today!
Yes, splendid work. 
I'll be off, then. 
Bye bye! 
Now that work was over, we changed out of our uniforms and prepared to head back to the dorms.
Hana was down in the dumps yesterday, but she was back to happily serving customers and baking cakes.
With that, group morale deepened and the store began to flourish.
Mm?
Oh, Kenta...
Oh, hey. 
I greeted Makoto casually, only to suddenly feel a sharp glare from behind me. 
...!
Oh, no... Not again...
...!
Hana walked up to Makoto with big, intimidating steps. 
...
Their eyes met.
...!
...
Her icy glare was so potent, I could swear beams were about to shoot out of her eyes. Makoto, however, looked as cool as a cucumber.
Ah, yikes...
...
We watched over the explosive situation frightfully.
Makoto?
Yes?
I'll admit, begrudgingly, that your new cake was quite good.
I... honestly tip my hat to you.
I see... Thank you. 
I have a request for you, actually. Could you please teach me how to make it?
Hana lowered her head to Makoto.
Kenta & Shinono & Michiyo
...?!
We gasped silently, but Makoto's voice remained calm and collected.
You don't need to bow your head to me.
Huh...?
Hana looked up, her gaze fixed on Makoto.
Makoto began scribbling something onto a small notepad.
Here you go.
Almost like she were handing Hana a simple grocery list, she nonchalantly handed Hana the recipe.
Thank you. 
After expressing her gratitude, Hana turned and headed for the door.
Huh? Wait... Hana...?
I want to make it right now!
With that said, Hana left the office. 
...
And I was left behind, confounded. 
Hana's amazing. 
Huh...?
I mean... she bowed her head to me. That's amazing.
Yeah, it is...
Being forthright about how good your rival's dish was, lowering your head, and asking for the recipe...
Not everyone could do something like that...
She's so proud and hates to lose...
That part of her terrifies me. She's really talented.
You think so?
Yes. She's no genius, but that talent matures with experience. No, if anything... maybe calling her an artisan would be more appropriate.
And, for that reason, Makoto's expression grew mischievous.
You look happy. 
I found myself saying that aloud.
Hm? Do I?
Her words were evasive, but the smile on her face remained unchanged.
Hehe, you and Nekodomari-san both look happy, Onii-chan.
Huh...?
Crap. Before I realized it, I was grinning along with her.
I'll, uh, go check on Hana.
Almost like I was running away, I followed after her.
