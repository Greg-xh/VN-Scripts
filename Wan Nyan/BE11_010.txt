Right, I'll go with this...!
Er... One?
Really? I got one, too! That means we're partners, right?!
Looks like it. I'm glad to have you.
We drew the same straw, so I guess that means we're together.
Ahaha, looks like I lucked out.
Is everyone else done?
Why do I have to team up with Makoto and not with Yanushi-kun?!
It's the luck of the draw and there's no arguing that.
You seem to be taking this too well! Do you have some ulterior motives by teaming up with me?!
I'm just not childish enough to complain about something that's been decided at random. 
Grr! Are you implying I'm childish?!
You're not being very mature right now, if nothing else.
Y-You annoying skank!
I'm with Koro-chan and Micchan. Let's have fun!
Let's do it!
H-Having more people makes it... a bit easier... Yes... 
You're as white as a ghost, Miichan, and you're shaking, too.
You don't deal with scary stuff very well, do you...? You can stay here if it's too much.
Don't be a heartless fool! I won't be left behind all alone. I'm going!
Hehe. I like that frightened look on your face, Micchan. It makes me want to glomp and lick you.
Ahaha... Anyway, team number one goes first.
Right. Are you ready?
Yeah, let's get this test of courage done with already!
