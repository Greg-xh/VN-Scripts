Nono and I were now in a relationship...
We couldn't go back to being just friendly cousins anymore...
Nono wanted this and I chose to answer her desires. Feeling regret would be wrong.
Nothing would ever be the same between us, so maybe we could take our relationship to the next level.
All right. I should probably get some sleep now that I'd thought things over.
Good night, Nono.
