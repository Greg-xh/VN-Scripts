W-We're finally back... 
I thought I was going to die... 
Are you okay? You're as white as a ghost!
If you think{W:700} this{W:0} is "all right," then go to the hospital and get your stupid head examined.
It wasn't that scary, though? I actually thought it was going to be much worse.
You're sure talking a big game. 
Why, of course. 
I'm unbelievably sweaty... When was the last time I broke out into such a cold sweat...?
Hehehe. Micchan's so cute when she's scared. Makes me want to glomp her and lick her ears...
Haaa... Haah... Need water...
She's too out of it to even make a comeback...
I didn't think you'd be this scared. 
I said as much at the start...
Mmm. I thought we could do some party games after, but I don't think you're quite up for it...
Do you wanna just kick back and chat for a bit instead?
Yes, please... I won't be able to fall asleep if you left me as I am...
If you don't feel well, you can always go up to the room and lie down.
That would help... 
It really would... 
I thought it would be fun, but I guess my test of courage backfired... 
Mmm. I thought we could do some party games after, but I don't think you're quite up for it...
It's a shame, but let's call it good for today. I'll try to think of something everyone can enjoy next time.
Please do... 
This concludes our test of courage. Thanks, everyone! That is all!
