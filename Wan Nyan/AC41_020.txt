Phew. We sure are busy today. At this rate, we'll run out of cakes before noon.
I know! Daifuku-san and I should eat some before they do!
Hey, hey! If you eat our products I'll have to punish you with a noogie!
Ooooh! But y-you're already giving me oooone! That hurts, Koro-chan! You're a meanie!
Meow~!
I'm not a meanie! You and Daifuku will eat all of us out of house and home!
Teehee.
Meow.
Haah... I guess I'll have Kenta make more.
Oh, Mako-chan already went to do that.
She did? That's good.
