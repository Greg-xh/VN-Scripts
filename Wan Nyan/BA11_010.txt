All right, time for breakfast! Gotta make sure I eat up so I'm ready for another day.
Oh, Senpai! Good morning. 
Good morning. You're awfully chipper today.
It's a great time to be alive! How about you, Senpai?
I'm doing great, too! 
Haha, I'd expect nothing less.
I'm not really sure what you mean by that, but thanks!
By the way, did you just come back from campus?
Ah... yeah. I had some stuff to do in one of the classrooms.
Like what?
Well, I'm working on something everyone will enjoy!
What is it?
Hehe, I'll tell you once we're with the others. Anyway, let's go to the dining hall!
Y-Yeah.
