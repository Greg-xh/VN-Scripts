I'm done cleaning up here. 
Same here. 
We're ready to close up shop for the day, then. Let's head out.
Good work, everyone. 
Let's take a shower and have dinner.
That's right, I have to get started on making dinner. 
It's a bit of a bother, but there's no way around it.
If we're in no hurry, would you be opposed to making it together?
That's no good, though. You're all just as tired as I am.
We work back-to-back as partners. You shouldn't feel guilty for receiving our aid.
Well, if you scratch my back, then I'll scratch yours?
Would you like to join us, Inukai?
Thanks, but I'll pass. 
I see. I apologize for intruding on your evening plans.
You had good intentions. You don't have to apologize. 
Could you make some dinner for me, too?
You can eat air for all I care. 
Eat air... 
I'm tired of looking at your foolish face. I'm off.
Well, jeez... I'm off, too.
W-Wait!
What is it?
Can we... talk for a bit?
I don't mind, but can it wait until we've changed?
No, it's fine the way we are... I don't want anyone to interrupt this. 
Is it something important?
Yeah... It's something really important to me.
Is something bothering you?
I guess... I think it does... No, it{W:700} is{W:0} bothering me.
If I can do anything, just say so. If you're in trouble, tell me and I'll rush to help!
Thank you. 
You don't have to thank me, it's you and me. I'd do anything to help you, that's obvious. 
Onii-chan...
So, yeah, what's the problem?
Give me a second...!
Phew, haa... Phew, haa... Okay! 
You get along really well with the other girls, right?
You asked me this before, haven't you? Yeah, I think I do. 
How do you feel about all of them?
How do I feel about them...?
They're my peers, my teachers, my comrades, and my friends all the same.
You're not going out with any of them?
What? No. It's not like that at all. 
Right... Then... Hmm, then...
Then?
How do you feel about me, then?
Where did that come from?
Just answer the question, it's really important!
Well, you're my cousin and like a little sister to me.
Like a little sister, but not{W:700} really{W:0} your sister, right? Not your{W:700} real{W:0} little sister!
Well, yeah, but that doesn't change how important you are to me.
Yeah, I know. I'm important to you. 
The big question is{W:700} how{W:0} important I am to you...
Don't you know? Siblings can't get married.
Obviously, it'd be bad if they could. 
However, cousins{W:700} are{W:0} allowed to get married.
...Yeah, I knew that, too.
In other words... What I'm trying to say is... I mean...!
I don't want you to treat me like a kid!
I might be younger than you and like your little sister, but I'm a grown-up!
I hate it when you treat me like a little kid!
That's what you wanted to tell me?
Right! Promise you won't treat me like a little kid anymore?
All right. I promise.
Promise? It's a serious promise!
I get it. I promise. 
I don't believe you.
Hey, trust me!
You forgot the most important promise we've ever made when we were little!
That was a long time ago, though? I won't forget something that fast.
Reeeeeeeally?
If you won't trust me, then this entire conversation is pointless. What can I do to get you to trust me?
You said I've become more feminine before, right? You weren't lying?
Of course not. 
Prove it, then. If you do, I'll believe you.
How am I supposed to do that?
Have sex with me!
W-Wait, how would that prove anything?
You can't have sex with your little sister or someone who's not of age, right?
Of course not. It'd be terrible if you could.
So, if we have sex, then it'll prove that you think of me as neither of those things.
I, uhh, don't think it will. 
So you{W:700} were{W:0} lying!
Do you have any experience with this, Nono?
Of course I don't. It's my first time, obviously...
Are you sure, then? You do realize what you're saying?
I wouldn't have said it if I didn't. I... understand everything.
I promise I won't regret it or complain later. So, have sex with me!
Well, damn, you{W:700} are{W:0} serious... All right, I'll do as you say.
If we're going to do this, I'll treat you like my lover... for now, anyway.
Yeah... Please, Onii-chan...
