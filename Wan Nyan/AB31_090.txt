Phew, I'm full. 
Food really did taste better after work. I'd always gorge myself, though...
Rolling around on the bed with a full belly after a long day at work was the best!
It's me, are you there?
Senpai? The door's open. 
Hi, sorry for coming in while you're resting. 
That's fine. Did you just get back?
Mhm. I'm sorry for leaving when I did. Was everything okay at the store?
Things got a little messy during the afternoon rush, but it wasn't anything we couldn't handle.
Right... I'll make up for the work I missed tomorrow. 
It wasn't like you did it on purpose, so don't worry about it.
It must've been something important for you to leave like that, right?
My dad... collapsed and had to be taken to the hospital.
What?! That's terrible! Should you really be here right now?!
It's fine, really! He had overworked himself and suffered a heat stroke, but should be discharged tomorrow.
Really? That's great... 
Thank you for worrying about us. 
I panicked and rushed to the hospital after they told me he'd collapsed. But, when I got there, he was fine. Kind of anti-climactic, huh? Ahaha.
That's good. Better that than it being bad enough that you couldn't joke about it.
No kidding. I thought I was going to go crazy until I saw Dad's face. 
You really love your dad, don't you?
Of course I do. No one hates their parents.
You really are great, Senpai. 
Why?
Gee, I wonder.
What's that supposed to mean?
Why didn't you tell us earlier, though? You could've said that much.
Everyone would've been really worried if I'd told you he was in the hospital.
That's true.
I couldn't do that while you were working. I didn't want to bother you with my personal problems.
Hmm. I feel like I'm missing something here.
Huh? What do you mean? 
I mean, your dad's one thing, but I'm more worried about you, Senpai.
About me? 
You said you were going to go crazy from worry earlier, right? If you were that anxious, I wish you had come to me about it.
I obviously can't do much, but if I could make you feel a little less anxious...
You know how venting can ease the pain?
And I'd never see any of your problems as a bother, Senpai. If anything, you{W:700} not{W:0} sharing is what bothers me most.
I feel bad that I'm so useless and unreliable that you didn't come to me.
That's not it at all! I rely on you all the time!
Next time something's bothering you, please don't hesitate to come to me! I'd do anything to help you!
Heheh... Ahahaha. 
Huh? Did I say something stupid?
Sorry, sorry. I'm not laughing at you. I just thought I had great taste.
What?
I'm proud of myself for falling in love with someone as wonderful as you. Go me! I have great taste.
I love you, Kenta-kun. I'll say it as many time as it takes.
Nekohana Korone loves Yanushi Kenta... like that. Heheheh.
Senpai... 
Anyway, I'll see you. I should tell Makoto-chan and Hinana-chan what happened.
Sounds good. I know they're worried about you, too.
Good night, see you tomorrow. 
Yeah, good night.
