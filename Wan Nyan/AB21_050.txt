We actually did{W:700} that{W:0} this morning...
Yeah, we did. Are you okay? Nothing hurts?
Everything's fine. We've still got a little time left, so maybe I'll take a shower...
Now that you mention it, we kinda have a lewd smell... 
Awww, we can't serve customers when we smell like this... 
I should probably take a shower, too.
W-Wanna j-join me...?
Are you okay with that? 
It would be a waste to go in one at a time, and there's no need for things to be awkward between us now.
I'm game if you are.
Let's go before someone sees us, then.
All right. I'll even wash your back.
I'm, uh, I'm embarrassed about it after all. I'll go in first, okay?
But... Well, either way, this was a pretty great way to start the day.
