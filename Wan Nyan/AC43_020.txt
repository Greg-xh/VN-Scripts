Aaah, aaah! This is Dock 2, Dock 2. Tailing the target now. Do you read, Dock 1?
Yes. Nono_I mean, Dock 1, here! I read you loud and clear. Pursuing Onii-chan_I mean, the target!
Uuu! I wanna know what Hana-san's doing with Onii-chan. I'm so curious! I want to tail him, too!
Hehe. The target will notice you if you follow him alone. It takes teamwork to tail someone!
You sure know a lot about this sort of thing, Nekojou-san!
Of course I do! Tailing and stalking people is one of my hobbies, especially when it comes to cute girls like you, Nono-chan!
Eeeeh, a criminal... She's a criminal!
Just kidding! I really like police dramas, is all. Anyway, staying in contact is important. We can't lose sight of Ken-chan and Hana-chan.
Isn't that right, Mako-chan?
Of course. 
You should go with them, Koro-chan.
Um...
...I think I'll pass.
...?
Kenta's not a little kid. As his Senpai, I think I should be on my underclassman's side at times like this.
Ugh. I'm not sure...
Nono-chan, Mako-chan, we've just received word from Micchan. She said it's almost time for someone to take over her post.
I'll go, then. Nekohana-san, you stay here and hold down the fort. 
Okay! Be careful out there!
...
They're gone. 
Meow~?
Do you want to go with them, Tai?
Meow~!
You're staying with us, then? Well, as his Senpai, I shouldn't get in the way of an underclassman's romance, either...
Even if I know that Inuta-san isn't the one he likes, right...?
