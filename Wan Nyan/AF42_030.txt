It's gotten rather late. 
Yeah, it's been a while since I've felt this tired. 
Heheh... We got a little carried away, huh?
We went from the coffee shop to the arcade to play rhythm games, wandered around a used bookstore, then hung out at a diner for three hours.
Hana may have teased me with a straight face, but she was just as tired as I was. 
U-Um, Yanushi-kun...?
Hm?
I had... a lot of fun today... 
I responded to Hana's surprisingly cute display. 
Me too.
Poof! 
Hana's face looked like it went on fire. 
Ah, um...!
I'll be going, then! 
Huh? W-Wait up...?
Hana ran for the dorms, as if running away from me.
It wasn't very ladylike... And we could've just gone in together with how close the dorm was.
With that, I followed after her.
