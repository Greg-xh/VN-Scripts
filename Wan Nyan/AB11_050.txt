I didn't think we'd come all the way to the campus. What are we doing here, anyway?
...
Senpai?
Ah, sorry... I need to talk to you, Kenta-kun. 
At night, in a classroom?
I wanted to go somewhere so no one could bother us...
Yeah, I'm sure no one would find us here. It must be pretty important if we came this far.
Yeah... It's really important. 
...Did I do something?
Huh? Why?
I thought I'd offended you somehow, and you wanted to talk to me about it.
No, no! That's not it at all! It's actually the opposite, and I think you're doing a great job!
That sounds a little condescending coming from me...
That's not true. If I'm doing something wrong, please tell me!
I'd expect you to do the same in return, Kenta-kun!
Mhm. So, what did you want to talk about?
Oh, mmm. That's right... 
Um...
Hmm... Mmm...
Is it something that's hard to say? 
I'm sorry. You're exhausted, but I still dragged you all the way out here...
I don't mind. I'll wait as long as you need me to. Take your time to find the right words. We can even wait until tomorrow, if you want?
No, I'll say it today! I've wanted to tell you ever since you got back from your training...
Really?
Mhm, I just... couldn't work up the courage. I can't leave things the way they are now, though!
That's why I feel like if I don't say it now, I probably never will.
I'll wait, then.
Thank you.
It's fine. I'd do anything for you.
...
Um... You know...
Yes? What is it?
I... I actuwaｩEww, I stuttered!
I'm not going anywhere, so there's no need to rush.
Ahaha... And I'm supposed to be the older one here. I'm pathetic.
Age has nothing to do with this. 
And if it makes someone as levelheaded as you panic, whatever it may be, then it must be important.
You're so sweet, Kenta-kun... 
I'm just average. 
No, you're sweet. 
You know... I really like you, Kenta-kun.
Thank you, Senpai. I like you, too.
...What kind of "like" do you mean, though?
Well, I like you as a person, of course!
Ahaha... That's what I thought. I knew that hoping for more wouldn't work with you, Kenta-kun. 
I don't really get it, but I'm sorry if I disappointed you!
No... In some ways, you did exactly what I expected. 
Did I do something wrong?
It probably won't make sense no matter how I say it... You'd always take it the wrong way.
I'm, uh, I'm sorry. 
It's really not your fault. That's just the kind of person you are.
I'll have to show you how determined I really am...! We'll be able to talk then!
W-Wait, what are you doing?! Why are you taking off your clothes?! 
It's so you'll understand what I meant.
I really don't get what's going on!
...Aaah, damn it! Are you trying to tease me or something?!
Would anyone do this just to tease someone?
R-Right... I'm sorry. 
Y-You can look now. 
S-Sure...
Wait, you're completely naked now!
It's fine. Don't look away and only look at me.
N-No, b-but, it's embarrassing...
It's ten times more embarrassing for me! Just look at me!
Okay, fine... fine... What's going on?
I'll say it again: I like you, Kenta-kun! You understand what I mean when I say it like this, right?
A girl wouldn't take off her clothes in front of someone she only liked as a person, would she?
At the very least, I wouldn't do it unless it's in front of someone I love.
...I'm sorry. That's the kind of "like" you meant, then?
Does it make sense now?
Well, yeah. Even I'd understand after all of this.
What I don't get is... what could a wonderful girl like you see in a guy like me?
That's obvious. You're a wonderful person, Kenta-kun.
I'm honored to hear you say that, but I don't really feel like it's true.
There are so many things I could say about you, and the list would be practically endless.
Even though I thought of you as a brother at first, I realized how amazing you were after all the time we spent together.
It made me happy and, before I knew it, my heart was beating really fast...
Sorting out how I felt about you took a while, but it was like all the pieces fell into place once I did.
When that happened, it was like the floodgates had opened. You were the only thing I could think about.
I love you, Kenta-kun... When it comes to you, I won't back down. I can say that for certain.
I'm sorry... I hadn't thought about falling in love, much less going out with someone...
But I{W:700} do{W:0} like you, Senpai! That much is true. I'm just not sure on the other stuff...
It's fine. I wanted to make my feelings crystal clear... I believe I've done just that.
With that said... Do I have{W:700} any{W:0} chance with you...?
I don't know if getting your hopes up is the right thing to do right now, but... I think you definitely do. 
I'm glad. I'll do everything I can to make you love me.
So, then... This isn't how it usually goes, but... I do have a request.
What is it?
I... I want my first to be with you...
Your first... kiss...?
That's part of it, but... I want to have sex with you...
Wh-Why?
Isn't loving you a good enough reason? I want to feel all of you.
Don't worry. I don't expect you to think of me as your girlfriend after... This is just me being selfish.
Or... do you not want to?
It's not that! You're gorgeous and have an incredible body... I've had dirty thoughts about you this whole time, and I'm really turned on.
I'm happy... You really do see me as a woman.
Of course I do. 
So, please... It's cold to stand here like this... Warm me up, Kenta-kun...
Senpai...
