All right, I've finished making this G｡teau au Chocolat. Next up is a Bｨche de No･l. 
You're postively bursting with energy today.
Yeah, I'm pumped up and ready to get to work!
I just hope you don't overdo it before we even open the doors...
I'm being careful so that doesn't happen. 
You've been in a really good mood all mroning. Did something good happen?
Not really. I enjoy the fact that I get to make so many cakes.
You're just a cake fanatic.
You may think it's an insult, but I see it as a badge of honor.
That sounds like something you'd say, Onii-chan.
It is very like Yanushi-kun, yes. 
All right, let's keep working!
