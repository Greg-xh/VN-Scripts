Maaan, time for some R and R... Phew. What a long day.
It was still too early to go to sleep now that I was off work for the day, so I was lazily lying around.
(I'm starting to get used to this job... I think. I can't say how{W:700} well{W:0} I'm doing, but I think I got the hang of it.)
As I stared up at the ceiling, I realized how I'd gone from a flustered mess to feeling much more relaxed while at work.
Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. 
Hmm? It's open, come in. 
Good evening! Good work today. Sorry for coming by so late.
Oh, Hina. Right back you. What's up?
Not much! Hey, Ken-chan, let's have sex!
...Huh? You want us to do what?
I didn't fully understand what she meant by her sudden declaration, and asked again for confirmation.
Well, you see, I kinda want to have sex with you...! So, can we do it?
That's why I'm here. You're not doing anything right now, right? Let's do it, then.
N-No, wait, sex isn't... it's not something you do just because you have free time... 
You can't just walk up to someone and offer to have sex with them like it's nothing... Um, what am I supposed to say right now...?
I was at a total loss. I didn't have the kind of life experience to help dictate how to approach this situation.
Just do whatever you want. It's better to regret your actions later than to regret{W:700} not{W:0} doing something, right?
And isn't it harder to{W:700} not{W:0} do what you want? If you want to do something, you shouldn't just ignore those feelings...
...I think it's better to not do something you'll regret, and think{W:700} really{W:0} hard on if you should actually do it.
Let's just do it, then. How about we do it now so we don't regret it later?
No, I'm telling you we shouldn't jump the gun on this... Forget it, when did you decide we were going to "do it"...?
What should I do? I can't just say, "All right, let's fuck like rabbits!"
L-Let's talk this out. Um, I'm glad you want to have sex with me, but I'm not sure we're ready for this... 
I just want to do it, so I'm gonna do it. Is that wrong? Don't want to do it with me, Ken-chan...?
U-Um, ah, it's not that you're the problem here... I mean, if I{W:700} had{W:0} to do it, I'd love for it to be with you, but... 
Y-Yeah... Hmm... W-Well, I guess... If you want to, um...
I didn't have a choice when she asked me something like that with tears in her eyes.
Besides, I doubt anything I'd say would stop her anyway, and it's not like I{W:700} didn't{W:0} want to have sex with her... Which meant...
Great, then let's do it! Be gentle with me, Ken-chan... Hehehe!
