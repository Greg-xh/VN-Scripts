Good day, and welcome to Beans Puppy!
There's an empty seat right over there. Feel free to take it.
We had a decent flow of customers today. Our name sure was spreading like wildfire!
I was certain everyone had agreed to join the study group, especially with the knowledge that we would bring in more customers if we improved upon ourselves.
Everyone was trying to come up with their own ideas. My fellow candidates really were a cut above the rest.
I see things are going well.
Oh, Nee-san. 
For the hundredth time, it's "Sensei." You're not doing this on purpose, are you?
No, no. It just pops out before I know it.
We have to set an example for the others. Do be careful.
Even if I am careful, I'll still end up saying it without thinking.
You give up too soon!
Anyway, forget that. Is being the only guy an inconvenience?
Are you getting along well with the other candidates?
It's not an inconvenience at all, and we're getting along just fine.
We're actually doing a study group after work, so we can think of ways we could attract more customers.
Oh... I'm impressed. 
As you can see, there's nothing to worry about.
Glad to hear it. Don't let your guard down and work hard until closing time.
Yes, ma'am!
