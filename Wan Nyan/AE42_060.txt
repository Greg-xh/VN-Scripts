Yes, yes. It's open. Come in!
Pardon me! 
Oh, ya look fired up. 
Why are you here this late?
I need some advice, Onee-chan!
That's "Sensei" to you, and what sort of advice? Is it related to the store or is it a personal problem?
It's a personal problem. 
Very well, ask away.
How do I get the person I like to notice me?
...Huh?
Like I said, I want to know how to get the person I like to like me back!
...That's what you need advice on?
It's really important to me!
I... I see... Yes, I can tell how much this is bothering you.
However, I'm afraid that... Uh, it's a pretty complicated issue.
Nyahahaha! I bet it is, considerin' you've never had a boyfriend in your entire life!
Whaaaaat, really?!
...I'm sorry. 
You've got nothing to apologize for, but... It's hard to believe you've never dated anyone given how pretty you are...
It's a problem with her insides! See, I bet guys can see that evil aura of hers from a mile away!
Asking Fuumin for love advice is like asking a bulldog for tips on chess, ahahaha.
Madam Chairwoman, we're going to have a serious talk after this. 
I'm sorry, I got carried away! Please don't shank me!
Tch... 
Oof, scary! She actually clicked her tongue at her boss...!
I see... So you've never dated anyone...
Maybe the ChairwoｩWait, that's even more impossible.
Pfft...!
E-Excuse you...! How dare you say that to me, you little brat!
Do you have a boyfriend, then?
Nope, never. Sorry!
Haaa... There's no one I can rely on here...
Nah. Even if we've never dated anyone, we can still try to give ya advice!
True enough, we do have more life experience than you do. We can probably give you some advice based on that and other people's experiences. 
Does that mean you can help me, then?
Let me think...
Mmm...
...
Please take care of this, Madam Chairwoman.
M-M-Me?! W-Well, have ya tried flirtin' with him? Boys are suckers for sluts!
Madam Chairwoman, please refrain from making statements that are unworthy of an educator, or I might have to crush your molars into dust. 
Yeesh...! Well, do you have any better ideas, Fuumin? It's rather childish to just sit back and complain!
...If you actually put some thought into it, you'd figure it out sooner or later.
Wha? No way. Definitely not!
No one can read your mind, so you've gotta vocalize your feelings or they won't get it!
What if the person I like doesn't get it even if I'm blatantly honest about it? What do I do then?
Then he's an idiot and ya need to kick him to the curb!
I won't give up on him!
You must take action, then.
Yeeaaah, if nothin' ya say gets through to him, just smack him until it does.
The saying, "A river cuts through rock" seems appropriate. Try to convince them and they may open up to you in the future.
That's right! Keep pushing, sister!
Keep pushing... Got it! I'll push and push until I've got him on his hands and knees!
Yeah! That's the spirit!
We pray for your success. 
I'll be going now. Thank you very much!
Ah, to be young...
Indeed.
