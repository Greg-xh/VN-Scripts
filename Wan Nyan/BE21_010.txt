How's it going? 
All good here! Who do you think you're talking to?
Well, uhh, you're Nono.
Th-That's not what I meant!
Oh, a roll cake. 
Yeah, I've never made one before and I wanted to challenge myself.
It looks pretty good. 
It doesn't "look pretty good." It{W:700} is{W:0} good because{W:700} I{W:0} made it!
You used a lot of fresh fruit and made the cake aesthetically pleasing.
Can I try some of the cream?
Huh? Yeah, sure. 
Mmm, yeah! That's good... The fruits' sourness brings it all together really well. It's perfect. I love it!
O-Of course it is. 
You've got great taste.
O-Of course I do. 
It's really good and you put a lot of thought into it. It's no wonder why you got chosen out of everyone in Paris...
J-Jeez! You're embarrassing me...
What's there to be embarrassed about? You should be proud.
I don't want to get ahead of myself.
Nah, you're really,{W:700} really{W:0} good at this. A genius!
Oh, you spoil me too much, Onii-chan...
