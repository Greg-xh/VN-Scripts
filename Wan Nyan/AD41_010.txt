Having finished our morning preparations, we gathered together for our daily briefing.
All righty, looks like everyone's here! Let's start today's meeting!
The chairwoman eyed the faces of the employees standing before her and cleared her throat.
A wide smile spread across her lips and she spoke in a childish, yet relaxed voice.
Weeeeell, I wondered if you noticed the influx of customers lately?
Or maybe you've been too busy with your day-to-day duties? I bet none of you have checked the sales receipts to know how many customers you've been getting each day.
Huh?
I thought this would be a normal briefing, but her eyes eventually fell on me after giving our group a quick once-over.
The others looked between me and the chairwoman.
Right, hmm... We've definitely gotten more compared to when we first opened, so there has been a noticeable increase.
Especially over the last few days. It's almost{W:700} too{W:0} busy at this point, and we made such an admission with a troubled smile.
Right. It's thanks to your hard work that we're seeing more and more customers.
You've been featured all over personal blogs and industry social media accounts day in and day out. We've been getting TV and magazine interview requests, too!
With the right media coverage, we'll only get more customers!
And next year will be as good as this one... I'll be rolling in cash! Heheheh...
Keep up the good work! There's not much time left, but keep doing your best! Hehe...
Ah, erm... Of course, I'll give it my all. 
We exchanged passing glances and all shared a similar-looking smile.
The fruits of our labor were starting to show, and a mixture of relief and elation filled our hearts.
Now I'll make a huge killing and live in luxury... Heheh, heheheheheh...
That's great... We'll be getting even more customers. Yup, yup... 
We ignored our greedy manager and instead saw our efforts as nothing short of a delight.
