Even during the summer, it got pretty chilly at this time of night.
Yeah, the breeze feels nice.
Do you like the change in atmosphere? 
Yeah, I'm not scared anymore. Thanks.
Don't mention it. I'm glad you're relying on me. 
Really?
You did that a lot when we were little, but not so much anymore.
That just shows how much you've grown up, but it does make me feel a little lonely...
When you{W:700} do{W:0} rely on me, even if it's something small, it makes me feel like I can be of use to you somehow.
You just can't be without me, can you, Onii-chan?
I never thought we'd see each other again, and you{W:700} are{W:0} special to me.
You're hopeless.
No kidding. Or maybe we've just been apart for so long it just made it worse.
I should probably grow out of these feelings at some point, though.
You don't have to!
I-I don't?
I mean, you feel that way because you love me, right?
Well, yeah. 
You don't have to grow out of it, then. It'd be impossible for you to do it anyway!
Someone's sure of themselves.
You can't help how you feel, so it'd be weird to not enjoy it!
You should just focus on loving me forever and ever!
Haha... Well, now that you've given me your explicit approval, I guess I'm fine the way I am.
Yup, stay that way!
The moon sure is bright tonight...

Aaah... Nnn... Noo... 
Mm? Did you say something?
I didn't say anything.
...Maybe I imagined it. 
Woman's Voice
Aaaah... That's good... More, over there...
There's no way I imagined{W:700} that{W:0}... It sounded like...
Woman's Voice
More... More, tease me more... Aaaah...!
Woman's Voice
I like it... I like that, do mooore... Good... I'm cumming... Aaah... Haaa...!
Erm...
Uh... It's, uh... getting late. Let's head back!
...
Nono?
Onii-chan... Let's have sex, too. 
Wh-Where did that come from?
M-My body feels... kind of hot. I won't be able to sleep with how aroused I am...
You{W:700} do{W:0} look turned on...
Onii-chan...
All right, I can't say no to you. 
Heehee.
