Mind if I join you?
Not at all. 
Oooh, bone and dog-shaped cookies. These are perfect for a dog-themed caf｣. 
That's part of it, but I wanted to put your earlier feedback into practice.
Oh, can the dogs eat these cookies, too? 
Yes. I kneaded all sorts of vegetables into the dough, so it offers a great deal of variety.
Veggies, huh... Like carrots?
Correct. There are some with carrots, sweet potatoes, and apples.
They're made to taste good for people, too. There's absolutely nothing to worry about.
It's a rather conventional dish to make, so it's nothing out of the ordinary.
That's not true. They look cute, and I'm sure the customers will enjoy them.
You really are the daughter of a western confectionary. Everything you've done so far seems so natural.
I have made more cookies than I can count, after all. 
Do cookies hold a special meaning for you? 
Cookies were the first thing I learned how to make.
They were awful, though. Not only did the dough not rise, but they were burned, too!
I was frustrated and practiced making cookies every day. That's all there is to it.
I see. You channeled that frustration and it's what made you into who you are today. Failure can be a good thing sometimes.
Hehe. I've never thought of it like that before, but that might be true.
I likely wouldn't have tried again had I succeeded the first time.
Like they say, failure is the mother of success.
That's right.
