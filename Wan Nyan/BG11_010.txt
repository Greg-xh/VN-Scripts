All right, let's go with this!
Um, one?
This is awful...
So you're my partner, Michiyo-san.
Unfortunately, I am.
...Would you rather switch with someone else?
No, so be it... In a way, this could be convenient for me.
How so?
Should my hatred for you exceed my terror, then I could easily overcome this devilish task.
Th-That's your reason...?
Regardless of how I feel, we will remain partners.
Ahaha...
If everyone's done partnering up, then team one should go first.
Let us finish this swiftly. 
Roger.
