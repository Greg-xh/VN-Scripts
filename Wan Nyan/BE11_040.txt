Right, time for bed.
Huh? Who could it be at this hour?
Right, come in. 
S-Sorry for coming so late... 
I wasn't expecting you, Nono.
Were you getting ready for bed? 
Forget that. What did you need at this hour?
Well... Everyone's gone to sleep already...
Not surprising given how late it is. We also have work tomorrow, so we really should get some sleep.
Why are you still up, Onii-chan?
Oh, I was sketching a new design idea I had and lost track of time.
So, hmm... Err... Urm...
What's wrong? Is it something that's hard to say? 
Not really, but it's still embarrassing... You might laugh at me...
I wouldn't laugh at you, promise. Don't you trust me?
Not when you won't remember our promise...
Err... Well, either way, I won't laugh at you. I'd do anything to fix whatever's bothering my cute Nono. 
Well... I'm scared and can't fall asleep on my own... So I thought we could talk for a little bit...?
That's all? Sure, I don't mind. 
Thanks, Onii-chan.
We could talk here, but maybe a change of scenery will do you some good. Wanna take a walk with me?
This late?
Are you scared? 
This isn't like the campus. I can take a walk outside when it's dark, no problem! I'm not that childish!
Let's go, then. Some fresh air might help you relax. 
I'll be counting on you then, Onii-chan. 
Right, leave it all to me!
