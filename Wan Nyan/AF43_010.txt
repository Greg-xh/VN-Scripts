That morning_
(For the first time in my life, I had my morning coffee in a man's room.)
(Even so, we're still students. We couldn't openly admit that we were dating yet.)
(I went back to my room while everyone was asleep, and went to the morning meeting like nothing had happened...)
Oh?
...
(However, when I entered the office, what greeted me was a face I'd grown tired of looking at.)
Good morning.
A good morning to you. 
(I tried to walk by her to take my seat, but a thought suddenly came to mind.)
(Maybe... I could tell her about my relationship with Yanushi-kun.)
Heheh... Heheheheh... 
What...? You're being creepy.
Well, excuse me!
You just seemed so pitiful from where I'm standing. 
And you... laughed at me for it?
Hear me out, Makoto. Yanushi-kun and I have officially become a couple! 
Oh.
(Makoto sat down the moment those words flew out of my mouth.)
W-Wait! Wait just a moment! You do understand, yes?! Wh-What I mean is, Yanushi-kun and I have become lovers! The kind of love that has hugs and kisses!
Ohohohoh! How does it feel, Makoto? If you're jealous, feel free to screech in agony!
Hmm, congrats. 
(And that was all she said.)
Y-You...! Can't you respond with a little more emotion?! I've won, and you lost!
That's not how I see it. 
Huh...?
I don't really care if Kenta goes out with someone else. I'll be his wife in the end, and that's a win for me. At least, as far as romance is concerned.
Wh-What... What...! 
(I was shocked beyond words.)
(How does she always... always... know how to get on my nerves...?!)
You two are up early. 
...?!
Hah...?! I-I'm sorry...!
Wh-What?
Did I do something...?
I mean, yeah, we did stuff last night, but nothing should've pissed her off...
???
You guys sure are here early! 
I turned around and caught sight of the chairwoman and Fumiko-sensei cheerfully walking into the office.
After waiting for Korone and the others to show up, they began the morning assembly.
Now, we'd usually announce the MVP on the final day of the exam, but we have some good news to share for Kenta-kun before we start!
For me...?
Yup! Kenta-kun, have you heard of Lueur des ｦtoiles?
Huh...?!
L-Lueur des ｦtoiles...?!
That's a world-famous p｡tisserie...!
I remember hearing that they recently sent representatives to Japan.
Yup, that! That one!
The chairwoman pointed her index finger at Hinana. 
They apparently visited our shop recently and were incognito!
Huh... I didn't know. Did anyone notice them?
Everyone, myself included, shook their head at Shinono's question. Foreign customers weren't all that unusual, after all...
They visited both the Kitty Parlor and Beans Puppy, but they liked Kenta-kun's cakes the most.
What...?
That's... incredible... 
{W:700}My{W:0} cakes...?
That does strike me as amazing... If not very surprising... That's wonderful, Yanushi-kun!
And that's not even the best part! They liked it so much, ｦtoiles has extended an invitation to Yanushi.
What does that mean?
They want ya to train at their store!
That's... really incredible. 
Super incredible! 
Congratulations, Yanushi. 
C'mon, get stoked about this!
N-No, it's just... so sudden. 
My brain couldn't process everything that was being thrown at me.
It truly is amazing, though. No doubt about that.
This road... will surely allow you to improve your skills.
Haaa... And studying in France sounds so dreamy...
...Madam Chairwoman, when is he supposed to leave for ｦtoiles?
Well, they want him to leave as soon as possible, maybe even today if he can. He should be gone for... Hm, at least three years?
Congratulations, Kenta-kun.
Congrats, Ken-chan! 
That's wonderful, Onii-chan! 
This just shows your efforts were officially recognized.
Congratulations, Kenta.
Um... Uh...
Everyone congratulated me and clapped, just like the final episode of a certain anime.
Ya should be happy, Kenta-kun. Deals this sweet don't come often!
Y-Yeah...
...
I turned to look at Hana. 
She turned her lonely eyes toward me and clapped all the same.
This should be a good thing, so why couldn't I be happy about it...?
