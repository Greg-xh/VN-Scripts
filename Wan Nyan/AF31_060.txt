Ah.
Kenta & Hana
Ah...?!
We ran into Makoto following our return to the dorms.
Ugh... Ugh... Grrr... Ugh... Ugggh...!
Hana was visibly ready to snap at any moment.
Hey, chill out, Hana.
I pulled Hana by the collar and greeted Makoto.
H-Hey, you're up late. Working hard...?
Yes, I was working on making a new cake until a moment ago...
A new one? Even... after making that the cherry cake, you're...
It's nothing to be surprised about. I had to find a way to keep myself busy until you two were done with your "training."
Twitch...! 
Our faces flushed bright red, our eyes darted about, and we erupted into a nervous fit of laughter.
Aha! Ahahahaha! 
Oho! Ohohohoho!
R-Right! We had to "train" really hard to counter your new cake!
Yes, that's quite right! 
Really? Are you two done now?
W-Well, you know what they say... Trying too hard can be bad for you...
I agree. Wasting too much stamina isn't healthy.
Twiiiiiiiiiiitch...!
I heard my heart skip a beat in utter terror.
Aha! Ahahahaha!
Oho! Ohohohoho!
I-Is Makoto saying all this stuff because she knows everything?!
Makoto, who looked calm and composed as ever, walked up to me.
Maybe next time it will be my turn to take you for a spin?
Makoto's arm coiled around mine. 
Kenta & Hana
...?!
W-Wait just a moment, Makoto! 
Don't worry. Unlike you, I won't make him work for it.
Huh...? Wh-What are you saying...?
Makoto ignored Hana's reply and whispered in my ear.
Wanna go for a walk through the park with me?
Huh? S-Sure, if it's just a walk...
...!
Haaah?!
Let's go, then.
H-Hold on a second!
Hey... Has anyone ever told you how selfish you can be sometimes? Are you planning on hogging him all to yourself?
Grrr... Grrrrrr...!
Oh, right. I've got a gift for you.
Flutter... 
Makoto tossed a piece of memo paper in Hana's direction.
Huh?
The paper floated through the air, and Hana consequently caught it.
I-Is this...?! 
The recipe... for your new dish...?
...
Makoto left the now dumbfounded Hana in her wake and dragged me along with her.
