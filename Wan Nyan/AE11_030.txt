(I can't take my eyes off that doofus for a second!)
(Who knows what would have happened if I hadn't showed up?!)
(I've gotta stay vigilant from now on!)
(For the time being, I gotta appeal to him more aggressively!)
(Once he realizes I'm the only one for him, Onii-chan will stop looking at other girls!)
(For now, let's focus on cooking! Mom always said the way to a man's heart is through his stomach!)
(And I might not look it, but I'm a great cook! I'll have Onii-chan eating out of the palm of my hand in no time!)
(Or so I thought...)
Whoa, this is great! Your cooking is always the best, Hina!
I'm nothing compared to Dad...
Master's cooking{W:700} is{W:0} amazing, but yours is great, too, Hina!
Thank you. Seeing you enjoy it so much makes me feel like it was worthwhile.
I'm enjoying it{W:700} because{W:0} it's so good.
Hehe. I'm so happy.
Me, too. Being able to eat something this good first thing in the morning makes my day!
(Grrr! She got ahead of me!)
(I can't beat someone like Nekojo-san, especially when she's practically a professional chef as it is!)
(I can't believe my strategy failed agaaaaain!)
Damn. It's so good, I can't stop eating.
There's plenty more, so don't hesitate to if you'd like a second serving.
Really? Can I have more, then?
Yes, of course. 
You always leave me satisfied, Hina.
Oh, it's just food. It's nothing to fuss over.
No, no, this kind of quality is something people pay for. Eating it for free would be bad for my conscience. 
Wow, I didn't know you had a conscience, Ken-chan.
Wow, rude! Is that how you think of me, Hina?
Heheh, just teasing! I don't think badly of you.
Really?
Only partially.
Hinanaaaaaaaa!
Hehe, no need to worry. I don't think that way at all.
Jeez...
So, what were we talking about?
Me thanking you for the food.
Oh, that's right. I don't want anything, but maybe I should come up with something just so we're even?
I'd appreciate that, yes. 
In that case, stand still...
Hmm? Like this?
Gloooooomp!
Mmmmf?!
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What do you think you're doing?!
Oh! Good morning, Shino-chan!
No, I've been here the whole time!
(Even though I've been hiding and watching you two...)
Forget that! What are you doing to him?!
It's a hug. Nnn, that tickles.
Mmmmf! Mmmmg!
If you keep fidgeting like that, I'll start feeling funny.
Mmmmf! Mmmmg!
No, you're smothering him! He can't breathe! He's red up to his ears!
Oh my, I hugged him a bit too tight.
Phew...! I was about to drown in a pair of boobs...!
By the way, Shino-chan, do you want some breakfast? I've got plenty of leftovers, so don't be shy!
Grr... Fine, I'll have some.
