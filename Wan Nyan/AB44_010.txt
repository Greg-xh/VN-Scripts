Good morning! 
Huh? Is something wrong? Feels kinda tense...
Ah, Kenta-kun. Shinono-chan is...
Did something happen to Nono?
Please say something to her, too, Ken-chan.
Nono...
Ah... Morning, Onii-chan. The weather's really nice today, huh?
This is not the time to discuss the weather.
Your eyes are all red and swollen. This is serious. 
Her voice is a bit hoarse, too... She was crying all night long.
Could you tell us what happened? I'll help if I can.
Nothing happened, I'm fine. 
You don't look "fine" to us...
I agree.
Do I look that bad?
You don't look like your usual, cute self, Nono-chan.
If nothing else, we can't let you face the customers when looking like that.
Agreed. You'll only worry the customers.
It's really that bad...? I'm sorry.
You don't need to apologize. Please tell us what happened.
Like I said, nothing's wrong.
Obstinate girl. 
Nothing happened, so that's the only answer I can give you.
Thank you all for worrying about me, but I'm really okay.
All right... Everyone has a thing or two they don't want to share. Let's leave it at that.
True enough.
If something else does happen, you can always come to us!
I will! Thank you.
I see you're all here. Let's start our morning briefing.
