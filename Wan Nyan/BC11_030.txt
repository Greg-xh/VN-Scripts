W-We're finally back... 
I thought I was going to die... 
Are you guys okay? You're as white as a ghost.
If you think{W:700} this{W:0} is "all right," then go to the hospital and get your stupid head examined.
I-It wasn't{W:700} that{W:0} scary! I actually thought it was going to be much worse.
Your knees are shaking. 
They are most certainly not! 
Hehehe. Micchan's so cute when she's scared. I was so excited when she clung to me and wouldn't stop shaking...
Haaa... Haah... Need water...
She's too out of it to even make a comeback...
I didn't think you'd be this scared. 
I said as much at the start...
Mmm. I thought we could do some party games after, but I don't think you're quite up for it...
It's a shame, but let's call it good for today. I'll try to think of something everyone can enjoy next time.
Please do... 
This concludes our test of courage. Thanks, everyone! That is all!
That ended sooner than I thought it would... Oh well, I can go back and relax in my room for a bit.
Kenta, where are you running off to?
My room. Why?
You can't possibly be completely satisifed, can you?
What do you mean?
I'm afraid this is nowhere near the level of intimacy I was expecting to get out of this relationship.
Are you upset the test of courage ended so soon?
That's one way to put it, yes.
What did you have in mind, then?
Would you like to join me and make some sweets?
Sure. I've got nothing better to do anyway.
I knew I could count on you.
