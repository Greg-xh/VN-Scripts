Hehehe!
You've been smiling this whole time. Are you really that happy?
Of course I am. They called me your "cute girlfriend." Why wouldn't I be happy?
Mhm. It's nice that they complimented you.
They complimented you, too. 
That was just an added bonus, or lip service.
No way. Maybe they were talent scouts looking for models?
I was surprised, though. We were just walking around and they asked us if we wanted to try modeling.
That proves how good we look together!
They also wanted us to model for wedding hall pamphlets back when we were in the academy.
They probably just caught a whiff of our happy couple aura. 
You think so?
It{W:700} is{W:0} for a wedding, which is one of the most important events in a person's life. They wouldn't ask someone who looked miserable.
Yeah, that makes sense. 
We're just{W:700} that{W:0} incredible! Talent scouts really do have a good idea.
Every girl dreams of her future wedding dress, so being chosen for something that dreamy made me really happy.
You should do it, then. Why did you turn them down? They looked like the real deal.
I like wedding dresses as much as the next girl, but I only intend to wear one once.
I won't wear it unless I'm at the altar, swearing to love until the day I die. 
But man, you'd probably look really pretty in a wedding dress.
Of course I would. I'd wear it in the happiest moment of my life!
I'd love to see it. 
I think you will. You'll be closer than anyone else...
Did you say something? 
N-Nothing. Just your imagination!
Really? I thought I heard something, but I guess my ears were playing tricks on me.
Right, right! Playing tricks on you!
The happiest day of your life, huh...? The best, most unforgettable day ever...
Wouldn't a wedding cake that celebrated such a magical event be the Ultimate Sweet?
!!!
Man, I'd love to do that someday. Make a bride's special day even brighter with a cake I made. 
...
...Wait. Wait a sec. I get the feeling this isn't the first time I thought of making a wedding cake... Am I just imagining it?
No, I'm not. There's no mistaking it, I've thought about making a wedding cake before. 
I swore I'd do it, but to who...?
...And when? When and who did I make that promise to?
...
...
...
...Ah! 
What's wrong?
No... It's nothing. 
No, it was definitely something. Yeah, that's right... I remember now.
Was that really it, though? Was that what Nono was so obsessed about?
Oh, the movie's going to start soon. We gotta hurry!
R-Right!
