One thing led to another and I ended up taking a walk through the park with Makoto.
How many years has it been since I got to talk with Makoto alone like this...?
...Mmm, how many years has it been since I got to talk with you alone like this?
Hm? Ahaha, I was just thinking the same thing. It's been pretty crazy recently, after all...
Mmm... Like... What happened just now?
N-No! That was, hmm... We were just working on a new cake, so it's nothing suspicious about that...!
I should hope so. No one would do anything suspicious in the kitchen, would they?
Twitch! 
I shook my head wildly and felt as though my heart would practically leap out of my chest.
O-O-Of course not...!
Yeah... 
Makoto smiled quietly and cast a meaningful glance my way.
Wait, don't tell me... Did she know about me and Hana...?
Ah, but... Hana's really something! It's admirable how hard she's working to beat you, but training at this hour...
You sure are talking about Hana a lot...
Twitch! 
My heart skipped a beat again, and I tried desperately to come up with some sort of excuse.
I... I mean, I spend a lot of time with her, so... She's the troublemaker over at Beans Puppy, so... Ahaha...
Right... But, when you're with me...
Makoto suddenly sat down on a bench, and motioned for me to sit next to her. 
Ah! Right, Hana sat on this bench last time, and...
I started to say, and quickly fell silent.
I was going to tell her how we interrupted a couple last time, but... I was on a date with Hana back then... 
...
Even Makoto, who was usually as cool as a cucumber, gave me a rather grumpy look.
Aha, ahahaha... 
I scratched my head while trying to change the subject, almost like an old cartoon character, and sat down on the bench.
You can... sit a bit closer to me. 
Huh...? 
I looked down and saw Makoto rubbing her exposed thigh against my leg...
Was she... flirting with me...?
Why don't we chat for a bit and try not to talk about Hana?
Huh...?
Maybe you'd prefer a more... physical kind of conversation...?
???
Hold it right there!
Kenta & Makoto
...?!
???
You, skanky slut, tried to fool a pure maiden's heart and indulge in impure acts under the veil of the night!
A figure popped out from behind the bushes...
I won't forgive your conniving ways! 
H-Hana...?! That was a pretty cool entrance you made just now...
Hana dismissed my comment, reached out her arm, and...
Pinch! 
O-O-Ouuuch! You don't have to do that, I'll move!
For the time being, I put some distance between me and Makoto.
You set me up, Makoto! 
Point! 
Hana pointed her index finger in Makoto's direction.
...
Makoto simply replied with an amused chuckle.
You set me up! You said that was your new recipe! 
Hana gripped the piece of paper and stuck it out to face Makoto.
I didn't say a word. You just jumped to conclusions on your own.
Y-You little...! 
Hana dropped the slip of paper during the chaos.
Was that the piece of paper Makoto gave Hana earlier?
I caught it in midair and examined it...
Um... "Mad Love x Sensuality x Catharsis!" "Confinement By a Boy ~How My Step Brother Trained Me~!" "He Loves Me So Much He XXXed Me, An Audio Extravaganza!" "Yandere Heaven!" and "Captivity ~Obscene Torture..."
Don't read it aloud, for the love of God!
Hana snatched the note from my hands in a huffy rage. 
Wh-What was that?! I'm getting chills...!
St...! It has nothing to do with you! 
They are yandere hunk verbal abuse CDs...
You shut your mouth! 
...?
I... don't get what's going on... 
Simply put, Hana dropped a list of her favorite female-oriented audio CDs and I kindly returned it to her...
You don't need to explain it! 
I, uhh... I can't say I really get it, but why did you write down that stuff...?
C-Can we change topics already, please?!
Heheh... 
Kenta & Hana
...?
This is kind of... nostalgic. 
Huh?
Doesn't this remind you of old times?
Oooh, yeah, definitely! We'd always hang out like this back in Kyoto. 
She was right; our little "gang" was quite nostalgic.
Makoto would always stand next to me, while Hana took the lead...
Don't you mean I would stand next to you and Hana tried to sandwich herself between us?
You're wrong! You'd always steal him away from me and I was trying to stop you!
Ahahaha... 
Ah, yes. They'd start bickering and I'd get caught up between them, laughing awkwardly.
But, you know... I never thought the three of us would hang out together like this again. 
Hana & Makoto
...?! 
My innocent comment ground their loud bickering to a halt.
W-Well, yes... I suppose... 
You learned everything we could teach you in such a short amount of time, then left before we knew it...
Nah, your dad was just really good at teaching. 
Hana & Makoto
...?! 
Huh...?
This time, my reply seemed to have annoyed them.
Yanushi-kun?
Do you have any idea how bad we felt after you left? 
Huh?
Did I do something wrong...?
Haa... You never change, do you, Kenta...?
Yes. He will never fully comprehend the mind of a woman.
They nodded at one another in agreement.
Heheh...
Hahaha... 
But yes, it's like you said. "I never thought the three of us would hang out together like this again."
True.
Well, it's too bad, Makoto. You probably would've quit while you were ahead back then, but now you can't make anymore excuses!
Yeah, not being able to see you get all red and flustered anymore is kinda sad...
Hmph! You do realize how much Yanushi-kun's utterly thickheaded nature has saved you until now?
That applies to both of us, though.
...Well, there's no denying that.
Haha... Ahahaha...!
Heheh... Heheheheh...!
Huh? Well, I'm just glad you two made up. Haha...
They turned to me in amazement.
...
...
See? He doesn't get it at all.
True, true. 
Huh? What...?
Let's head back, then. 
Yes, we need to get up early tomorrow, too.
They simultaneously reached out and shook each other's hands.
Starting tomorrow, we are doing this, fair and square.
Yeah. 
They stood, side by side, in a friendly fashion and headed back to the dorms.
Huh? Hey! Wait up! Is this a lesbian thing? Are you two gay now or something?!
They left me behind to drown in my flustered panic.
