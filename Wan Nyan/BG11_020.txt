Whoa, you can really see all the stars tonight.
...
Michiyo-san hadn't spoken a word since we walked onto campus... Looks like her fear outweighed her hatred of me.
What a relief. I felt some mixed emotions about it, but it certainly made me feel a bit more at ease.
Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
It's okay! The wind just made the window shake.
Th-The wind...?
Yeah, it was just the wind. Calm down.
I swear... How vexing...
Would talking help? Talking may distract you.
Indeed... I loathe going along with one of your suggestions, but I suppose it's better than nothing.
Beggars can't be choosers, huh?
What do you propose we talk about, then?
Hmm, let's see... Maybe you could tell me about some of the things you like.
Why would I reveal that information?
It would be depressing to share the things you dislike, so it's best to stay positive and talk about things you enjoy.
...I like dogs.
Yeah, I knew that. You have three dogs at home, right?
We have six now, actually.
You adopted more? You really{W:700} do{W:0} like dogs... Don't you feel lonely being away from them over summer vacation?
Of course I do. Why state the obvious, you fool?
Sorry, sorry. Are your six dogs all different breeds?
I have a Shih Tzu, a Pomeranian, a Yorkshire Terrier, a Toy Poodle, a Pug, and a Shiba Inu.   
They're different, but small dogs.
I obviously love large dogs, too, but I would prefer to raise one once I'm out on my own.
You want to get even more dogs? 
Is that a problem?
No, of course not. Anyway, we're here.
Ah... Already? 
That's just shows how focused you were. See, talking about your interests makes you forget about all the bad stuff.
Let's grab whatever's supposed to be in the classroom and head back to the dining hall.
Yes...
