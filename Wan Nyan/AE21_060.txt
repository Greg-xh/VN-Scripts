Back, safe and sound! Thanks for watching over me, Prince Charming... Hehe, just kidding!
You were a big help, though. It made me feel safe to have you around.
Let me know if you need help next time, too.
Will do! I'll figure out a way to pay you back sometime.
Don't worry about it. I got some yummy treats out of it, so let's call it even.
Mom gave those to you, right? And I haven't thanked you properly yet...
I didn't do this because I wanted something out of it. It's really okay.
Either way, I'd feel better if I did{W:700} something{W:0} for you.
All right. Well, I'll let you know if I need help with anything.
Sounds great!
That works for me, then.
You're so selfless... It'd be pretty bad if you were a selfish person, though.
I'm going to go change out of my uniform.
Sure. Thanks a lot, Kenta-kun. Bye-bye!
See you. 
All right. Time to change and get some dinner.
...I wonder how Nono's doing? Is she still at the store?
Hmm... Maybe I should go check on her?
