Hiya! 
...
Huh?
I walked into the chairwoman's office for our morning briefing and discovered no one was around. Perhaps I arrived too early?
Well, now what? There was still time before we opened up shop, so I considered swinging by the dining hall to make myself a cup of coffee...
???
Zzz... Zzz... Zzz...
Mm?
I thought I heard something strange just now...
I looked around, but couldn't determine where the noise was coming from.
What's going on?
After searching the room for the potential source, I eventually found it hidden under the desk.
Zzz... Zzz... Zzz...
Whoooooooa... 
As expected, PochiTama's esteemed Madam Chairwoman was fast asleep under her desk. 
What do I do about this...?
I gently shook her shoulders to try and wake her up without startling her.
???
...Ugh, what are you doing, Madam Chairwoman...?
Bang!
Aaah, ouch! 
The chairwoman woke up with a start and her eyes flew open.
Wh-What?! H-Huh, K-Kenta-kun? Why are ya goin' around smackin' people?!
Huh? N-No, it wasn't me... 
Cut the crap! There's no one else in here but us!
???
Madam Chairwoman!
Huh, Fuumin?
Don't you 'Fuumin?' me. A chairwoman does not fall asleep in her office like this! 
Hmm, well, whatevs. Isn't it almost snacktime?
No, therefore...
What's today's snack, then?
Haa...
Yikes...
I just caught a brief glimpse of all the grief Nee-san had endured...
Very well, we can have snacktime now.
Yayyyy!
The chairwoman sat up with the intention of jumping into Nee-san's arms...
...However, before we do that. 
Whack! 
...Nee-san smacked the chairwoman in mid-air, sending her spiraling to the floor.
Oooooooouch! That hurts, Fuumin!
Before we eat, you{W:700} will{W:0} listen to what I have to say today!
...That's{W:700} preachin'{W:0} time, not snacktime.
If you have time for a snack, then you have time for me.
You understand, don't you? As chairwoman, your job is to represent this organization as a whole, and manage it as a business. You are, essentially, the face of this institution.
And when said chairwoman is a lazy dimwit who won't do her job, the insitutution's public image suffers and appears to be just as dimwitted.
Booooooo~
And so, our chairwoman puffed up her cheeks in sulky dissatisfaction as Nee-san's preaching continued in earnest...
