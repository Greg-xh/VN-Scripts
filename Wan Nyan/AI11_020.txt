All right, everything's stocked and the store is ready to go...
All that's left is cleaning! Cleaning, cleaning~@
We were advised to be more diligent with the cleaning, so let's go the extra mile today.
That's right. Inukai and I are in charge of cleaning the store's interior today...
Hana and I will take care of the outside, then. The store's pretty big, so let's give it a good sweep!
Very well, let us do a thorough job. We usually ignore the corners, so we should be mindful of that, too...
Let us give it our all, Yanushi-kun. I may not look it, but I pride myself on my cleaning abilities.
I'm not much of an expert in that department, so I'll follow your lead! Or something... ahaha...
After making sweets and performing our usual duties in preparation of opening the store, we divided up the cleaning supplies and smiled at each other.
We wanted to maintain a clean work environment so we could do our jobs without worry.
