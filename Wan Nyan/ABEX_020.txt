Sit wherever you'd like. Ah, can I get you a drink?
I'm fine. You don't need to worry about me.
Are you sure? Having you here is a huge lifesaver.
You must've been really bored. 
I'd wake up my roommate if I had one, but I'm, unfortunately, alone.
No, no. If you did have a roommate, you should let them sleep.
Nah, it's fine if it's a guy. 
I guess... You know, only having one guy here does feel kind of unfair.
It really is. I wouldn't be this desperate to talk to someone if there was another guy around.
You girls don't have to worry about that.
That's true. There's usually someone in our room, so there's never really a dull moment.
What do you guys usually talk about?
Hmm. All sorts of stuff, y'know? About the store, making sweets, where we want to go on our days off.
Oooh! So that's that mysterious girl talk I've heard so much about!
Girl talk...?
Those topics sound pretty normal, though. I thought it'd be more interesting.
What did you think it was, exactly?
I figured you talked about boys and who you liked.
Some girls do that, but not Makoto-chan or Hinana-chan.
And, if they were, it'd be kind of bad.
How come?
Well, because I like you. It'd be embarrassing to tell everyone that.
Oh, yeah, I guess that's right.
"You guess"? You didn't forget I confessed, did you?
I wouldn't forget that.
You better. I'd be{W:700} very{W:0} upset if you forgot we'd had sex.
...By the way, how did it make you feel after that?
After what?
I... I mean, did you start seeing me as a g-girl more?
I do. You're a wonderful girl, Senpai. 
There are a lot of wonderful girls here. Like Shinono-chan...
Why bring her up?
You two are just so close, and you're always talking.
We've known each other for a long time.
Even if she has known you longer, I get along well with you, too.
Senpai?
W-We still have time, so... let's have sex.
Excuse me?
I.. I said, let's have sex! Or do you not want to?
That's not it. I just wasn't expecting it. Are you sure about this...?
Positive... Look at no one but me for now...
