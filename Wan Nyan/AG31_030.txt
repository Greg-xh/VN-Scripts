That's all of it... right?
Yeah, should be okay.
We used the cart from the back of the storeroom to collect the items we needed for the caf｣.
It was hard work, especially with how large and heavy the bags of commercial-grade flour and sugar were.
This was harder than I thought... I did not think we would need this much.
Yeah. We used up a lot of ingredients, so we've got quite a bit of stuff to grab.
Phew... Having you around has been a huge help. Thank you, Yanushi.
You're welcome. I'm happy to help out whenever you need me to. Anyway...
Michiyo-san smiled when I wiped away the sweat from my forehead.
After loading the bags onto the cart and ensuring nothing would fall, I grinned back at her.
