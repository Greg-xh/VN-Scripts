So, how's it coming along?
I'm almost done. 
That was quick.
I thought ahead and made sure to ferment something ahead of time, so it's no big deal.
Are you making honey toast?
Yeah. That's another kind of sweet, right? 
True... And with you baking the bread, it'll taste even better!
It's a really pretty dish, too. You've got honey and whipped cream, topped with ice cream and a cherry.
Not only is it delicious, but it fits the caf｣'s image perfectly. What a great idea!
Hearing such praise is a huge motivator. I wouldn't know what to do with myself if you said it looked like I had cut corners.
What are you saying? I've never thought that way about your baking.
I know how much effort and love you put into it. 
Thanks. 
Yup, this is excellent! It's really easy to decorate and lends some variety to the menu. It's got nothing but positives.
Perhaps I could try rearranging the plate a little differently, then.
Go for it. I'm looking forward to it.
All right! I'll work hard to meet your expectations!
