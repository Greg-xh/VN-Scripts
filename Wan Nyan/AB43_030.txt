All right! Let's put our backs into it!
Someone's energetic today.
It's all thanks to you, Kenta-kun.
Did I do something?
You gave me some great advice yesterday, remember? That's what!
All I did was listen. It was no big deal.
That's not true. Without it, I'd be moping around and causing trouble for everyone.
Talking to you made me realize where my true path lies.
That was all on you, Senpai.
You're the one who gave me the push I needed, though. I really am grateful.
So again, thank you so much.
It's kind of embarrassing when you put it that way...
So, let's get started.
It'll likely be crowded soon, so let's wrap this up.
Mhm, roger that!
Senpai, be careful, there's a stepｩ
Huh?  Kyaaaaa!
Watch out!
O-Ouch...
Are you all right? Does it hurt anywhere?
Yeah, I'm fine. I can't believe I tripped on the same spot as last time... That's so lame.
Forget about that. I'm just glad you're okay...
You saved me again, Kenta-kun.
Th-That's not...
Uugh! She's so close...! Senpai's face was RIGHT THERE. If I just moved my head a little bit, I could kiss her...!
She's so pretty, too... Her lips are beautiful, and I can't help but be drawn to those sparkling eyes of hers...
This was bad! I was so nervous, it felt like my heart might leap out of my chest! How the hell was I so calm last time?!
Not only that, but we had sex a bunch of times! What's wrong with me?!
It felt like my brain was about to boil over... Crap, I gotta calm down!
Wait, are you hurt?
Huh? What makes you say that? 
Your face is red! Did you hurt yourself?
I... I'm okay! Nothing hurts!
Really?
Too close! I mean, yeah, really! Anyway, we should, uh, get up...
I know, but my legs are numb again... Sorry.
Are you all right?
I'm fine, I'm fine. It doesn't hurt. I'll be fine in a second.
All right, then... 
You're acting really weird today, Kenta-kun...
Am I really?
Well, you're sweating bullets, and you wouldn't look me in the eye earlier!
Y-You're just imagining things. 
Look at me, then!
I, uh... I'll have to decline.
Wha, why?! What do you mean, "Decline"?
I'm not in the mood right now... 
You're so weird. Are you hiding something?
I'm not hiding anything.
Well, whatever... Are you ready to go? Up we go.
Yup, we're all good now! Let's head back!
Y-Yeah.
