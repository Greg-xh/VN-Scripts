Aaah, that felt good. Heheh, having sex made me hungry. 
Want to grab something to eat with me later? C'mon, Ken-chan, heheheh...
R-Right... Sure, we can grab something later... You look really happy right now, Hina...
I figured we'd lie in bed for a little while longer, but it always came back to this. I could probably learn a thing or two from Hina's toughness, though.
Right, Ken-chan, maybe you could make a cake after we eat that would take all my fatigue away?
Yeah, no problem. I'll make you the ultimate cake, with an extra serving of love. From now on, I'll always make them for you.
Ken-chan... Thank you so much. I'm so happy! Heheh, heheheheh...
As lame as those lines were, I could say them now. Now that we've ascertained our love, there wasn't any bashfulness anymore.
Ken-chan.
Hina...
We smiled and held each other tight. It was a bit embarrassing, but heartwarming, and I brought her face closer to mine as I mouthed her name. 
Heheh, Ken-chan... I love you... I'm so happy we can be together like this... Heheh, heheheh...
Hina giggled happily in my arms, and that made me smile in turn. 
What cake should I make her today? And tomorrow and the day after that...? I would probably want to introduce some variety.
I tried imagining how happy she looked when eating my cakes. She'd probably go on about how tasty they were, all while stuffing her cheeks.
I had a feeling there were even more fun things in store for me tomorrow. I was already enjoying my life as it was, but I had so much to look forward to that I wouldn't know what to do with it all.
Ken-chan, I love you. I love you, and the sweets you make... I'll always, always love you, Ken-chan!
