Phew, I'm stuffed.
So, what should I do now?
I had nothing else to do after eating breakfast.
I woke up at a weird time and didn't feel like doing anything now that my schedule was out of whack.
There probably wasn't anything interesting on TV this early, either. What do I do...?
Good morning, Kenta-kun.
Good morning, Senpai. You came at just the right time!
H-Huh, I did?
I'm actually pretty bored right now. Mind if we chat a little?
Oh, so that's what this is about. Sure, let's talk.
Oh, thank you. I owe you my life, Senpai!
Ahaha, you're going overboard.
