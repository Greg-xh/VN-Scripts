I'm in love with Senpai...?
It didn't feel real, almost like it was too soon to jump to that sort of conclusion.
After consulting those two, I could say with absolute certainty that I was much more conscious of Senpai.
Hello, and welcome to the Kitty Parlor!
Three customers, yes? We have a table open by the window.
Female Customer
Excuse me, can I have some help?
Yes, I'll be right over. Please wait a moment.
It looked like everything was back to normal. Senpai really was at her best when she was her usual, cheerful self.
Her smile was dazzling. Just looking at it cleansed my heart...
Ah?! Why am I standing around daydreaming?! We're on the clock right now! Focus!
Kenta-kun?
S-S-S-S-Senpai?!
Wh-Why are you yelling? The customers are looking.
Oh... My sincerest apologies, everyone!
Is there something wrong?
Wrong? What could be wrong?
You're acting really weird... Are you okay?
I'm totally fine! Better than ever, actually!
Really? I'm glad, but... If anything's wrong, you can always come to me.
Thanks a lot. 
You don't have to thank me. You'd say the same in my position, right? 
Y-Yeah...
...Are you sure nothing's wrong? 
Positive. Why do you ask?
Your eyes look kind of panicked, and your face is red... Maybe you have a cold?
Like I said, I feel perfectly fine.
Hmm... Something still smells fishy to me!
Ahahaha...
Kenta, do you have a minute? 
What's up?
We're running low on flour. Can you get us three more bags from the storeroom?
Sure. I'll bring them right over.
Won't they be heavy, though? It'll be difficult to carry them alone, so I'll help!
Could you? I'll mind the store until you come back.
Please do. Let's go, Kenta-kun.
Y-Yeah.
