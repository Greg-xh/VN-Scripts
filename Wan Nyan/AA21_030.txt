Everyone should be familiar with Beans Puppy's layout by now.
The lot of you also seemed to agree with Yanushi's earlier sentiments.
While he's not wrong, there's one thing you're likely unaware of.
What's that?
I find "seeing is believing" to be the best approach... Wheeeuw!
A whistle? Why, Sensei?
Just wait and see. There, you can hear their footsteps.
Huh? Footsteps...?
Are those...?!
Dogs?! Where are there so many of them?
...How peculiar. 
First cats, and now dogs... Wait!
I see you've figured it out.
To be blunt, Beans Puppy is a dog caf｣.
A dog caf｣?! 
They were in kennels in the back so you could focus on your training, but these faithful canines are honorable staff members.
You may have some doubts, but please try and build a good relationship with the dogs. It'll influence the overall feel of the shop.
You say "try," but...
Mhm. I do not mind in the slightest.
I'm cool with it, too! I love doggies!
I, too, prefer dogs to cats, so I'm perfectly satisfied with this arrangement. 
Really? Well, I'm cool with it if you guys are.
I'd actually find it unfair if we{W:700} didn't{W:0} have the dogs with us.
What do you mean?
The Kitty Parlor has its cats, so we would be missing a major selling point without them and just look like a normal caf｣.
I wouldn't want to be at a disadvantage against the competition from the start.
Oh, yeah. I didn't think about it that way.
Hey, what's this doggie's name?
Number One.
What about this one, then?
Number Two.
Don't tell me this one is called "Number Three"...?
No, that's Number Four. Number Three is over there.
Did you really only give them numbers for names?
Numbers are easier to remember than names.
I guess so, but it's not cute at all...
I find this state of affairs unacceptable, and would like to raise an objection!
Let's hear it, then. 
It lacks love and affection. Referring to them by a numeral feels like they're prisoners!
Didn't you say they were "honorable staff members" earlier?
True, I did say that. 
As our shop companions, they should be treated with respect and given names!
That'd make us all equals.
I see your love of dogs hasn't changed a bit.
Shut your mouth, imbecile. 
She just glared at me... 
I really don't like the numbers thing, either...
I wholeheartedly agree.
Very well, I accept your objections. You may name the dogs as you please. 
Yay! I was kinda jealous watching the other girls name the kitties...
This one is... Hmm... Patches! Yeah, Patches!
Oh, because of his spotty fur?
That's right! Hello there, Patches. 
Woof, woof!
This one looks smarter than the rest, and has a certain refined masculinity to him.
A cool, yet attractive name would suit his beauty.
Something cool... How about GaiGanGar-Z?
H-Hmm... That does{W:700} sound{W:0} cool, but...
No good?
Not for an animal, no.
I agree. It's a bit much...
No way! What were you thinking, Onii-chan?
Toying with others' names... Do you think yourself to be God, you fool?!
You guys don't need to gang up on me like that!
I've got it! I'll call him "Romeo"!
Unsurprising you picked such a romantic name, Hana.
A-Are you making fun of me?! 
No, I meant it as a compliment.
I'm still not buying it. Heh, your name will be "Romeo" going forward!
Woof! 
I cannot allow the others to get ahead of me.
I mustn't ponder this too deeply. I will entrust this to intuition. 
Chihuahua
Nnn...
Yes, I've got it! From now on, you'll be known as "Chihuaboy."
Well, he{W:700} is{W:0} a male Chihuahua... That's about as direct as you can get.
We're done naming the dogs! Do you wanna name one, too, Onee-chan?
It's "Sensei."
A name, huh...? It wouldn't be right to leave Number Three as is after all the others have been named...
That's right!
Well, then, "Antoinette."
Why'd you choose that name?
Due to the abundance of cakes in this shop.
Huh...? Really? I feel like that name's kinda problematic...
Starting today, your name is "Antoinette"!
Woof!
W-Well, it doesn't seem to mind, so it's probably fine...
Let's just hope no guillotines pop-up during the exam. 
That's it from me. Any other questions?
Yes, I've got a question! 
What is it?
It hasn't come up yet, but you haven't told us when the exam was actually supposed to start.
Yeah, that's a pretty important detail.
Ah! Sorry, sorry. I forgot to tell ya, but it starts tomorrow!
...
...What?
Huh? Huh?! You're joking, right?
Nah, I'm totally serious.
Nee-san... 
It's true. Both shops will open tomorrow morning at 10AM.
Huuuuuuuuuuuuuh?! 
Are you surprised?! You've all been bamboozled! My surprise attack worked!
This is not the sort of surprise people actually wish for...
It's far too soon!
I'm not ready for this... What should we do?
It starts tomorrow...
That's crazy! 
I realize this is short notice, but there's no reason to get so worked up about it.
No, I'm pretty sure this is a normal reaction!
Haven't you all been training for this moment? There should be no problem for you, then.
Th-That may be true, but...
Heehee... Gahahahaha!
Onii-chan?!
This is just too perfect, so I couldn't help it!
Do you find this amusing?
In life, nothing ever goes as planned. It would be pretty boring if it did.
As they say, when life gives you lemons, make lemonade! So this sort of thing really gets me fired up.
Besides, as Nee-san said, we've trained for this. With a team as solid as ours, I'm sure we'll be fine!
Kenta-kun... 
I second what Kenta said. There's no point arguing when everything is already set in stone.
There are other things we could be doing rather than sitting around and complaining.
Makoto...
You're right... The customers shouldn't suffer because of us, so let's do it!
We've no choice but to steel ourselves, it seems.
Ooo! If I've gotta do it, then I'll do my bestest!
That's right! Let's make sure every customer enjoys their visit to our shops!
So, what do we do now?
For now, let's clean the front of the house.
Beans Puppy is one thing, but the Kitty Parlor hasn't been used in a while, so we should be thorough. 
All right, let's clean these babies up! 
Yeah!
Looks like they've got this under control.
So it seems. We should leave the rest to them.
That's right. Let's head back, Fuumin. 
I have a mountain of work for you to start chipping away at, Madam Chairwoman. 
Ahahaha, time to bail! 
What?! I'm not letting you get away!!
