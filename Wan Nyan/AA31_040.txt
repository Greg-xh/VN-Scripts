Thank you, and please come again!
Five groups of people entered the caf｣ within the first hour and a half. Was it normal to be this slow so soon after opening?
Three of those five parties were already waiting outside before we unlocked the door, so the pressure was on despite not knowing just how many people would come.
No, no. We had to stay positive. It's good they even showed up at all, and we had to work hard to keep up with them.
I'll do my best! After all, that's all I{W:700} could{W:0} do.
Thank you for waiting. Here you are, the cake of the day!
Saint Bernard 
Woof! 
Female Customer A
Whoa, look at that St. Bernard! It's so big... but really cute, too!
Female Customer B
Aaah, this place is so relaxing. There's dogs everywhere! It's like heaven for dog lovers.
Female Customer A
Mhm! It really is!
Female Customer B
What's this dog's name?
This is Sebastian. 
Female Customer B
Makes sense. He does look like a Sebastian. 
Female Customer A
He totally does! ...Huh? My cup's empty.
I'll have him get you a refill. 
Female Customer A
Him?
Female Customer B
Wow, that's so cool! Sebastian's giving us refills from the barrel on his neck!
Female Customer A
They do that for people who get stuck on snowy mountains, right?
Female Customer B
I think so! That's amazing. I can't believe we got to see it in action!
Female Customer A
Can I take a picture?
Of course.
Female Customer A
Yay! Mind if I upload this to my Twitter?
No, not at all. 
Thank you for waiting! Here's your iced coffee. 
Female Customer B
The show's great, but isn't this cake{W:700} super{W:0} good? Look how cute it is!
Female Customer A
It is. It's so cool that it's star-shaped, too!
The cake of the day is a fig and chocolate tarte.
Female Customer B
I'd feel bad eating it, but it looks too yummy to pass up! Om!
Female Customer B
Whoa... It's so good! What the heck, I've never had something so tasty before!
Female Customer A
Really? It's that good?
Female Customer B
Try it and you'll see what I'm talking about. Here, have some.
Female Customer A
Guess you're right. Here we go... Om!
Female Customer A
Hm?! Mmm! It's so good! I could tell the moment it touched my mouth!
Female Customer B
Hehe, right?!
Female Customer A
What's that smug look for?
Female Customer B
Did you make this, by chance?
No, the p｡tissier over there made it.
Female Customer A
Oh, that guy?
H-Huh? Why are they looking at me...?
Female Customer B
Whoa, he's cute. He reminds me of a puppy.
Female Customer A
Huh, so that guy made something{W:700} this{W:0} good?
Female Customer B
I hadn't heard anything good about this academy recently, but it seems pretty amazing to me.
Female Customer A
Yeah. I'm really glad we came!
Female Customer B
We'll have to come here more often, huh?
Female Customer A
Can we order takeout, too?
Yes, of course. 
Female Customer A
We'll order one to-go for our friends, then.
Thank you very much! 
The three of them looked awfully excited. Being praised like this was the best thing an artisan could hope for.
I had to get better so I could make even more people happy!
