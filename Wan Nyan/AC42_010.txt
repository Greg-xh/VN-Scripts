And a few days later... 
Please, Yanushi-kun! Please... G-Go out with me!
Woof!
...?!
Hey, we need to hurry up and finish cleaning.
That's right! We've got tomorrow off. If we go to bed early, we'll have plenty of time to play around later.
Just for a little bit! Since it's our day off tomorrow, would you mind going on a walk with Romeo and me? ...And maybe do some date-like stuff, too? That's all!
That's right. Maybe you should go train some more, Chihuaboy? Standing under a waterfall and extinguishing your worldly desires could open the path to becoming a lion.
Mmmph... 
Ahaha, I don't know about that. Patches is too small, and he might get swept away by the river!
Woof, woof!
Anyway, I don't know about waterfalls, but taking a nap under the sun in the park might be nice...
...Wait, a date?! 
Yanushi?! When did you sink your teeth into Hana?!
Took you long enough to notice!
That was the first thought that came to mind as I stared at Hana's perplexed expression.
Um... Right, so it's not that. You wanted to go on a walk, so... sure. Why not?
Thank you very much! I'll cherish tomorrow for the rest of my life! Romeo, let's get back to cleaning! We're going to have to turn in early for tomorrow!
Woof woof!
Did you hear that, Inukai?
Y-Yeah. This is getting messy...
