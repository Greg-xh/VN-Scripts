I thought I was going to die... 
I-It wasn't that scary...
You say that, but you look incredibly pale.
I know how you feel, to a painful extent...
You look pretty calm right now all things considered, Micchan.
Haha... It is not quite so bad once you try it. That's all there is to it. 
Really? Does that mean something happened between you and Ken-chan?
O-Of course not! I'd never let anything happen with this imbecile!
Hmm... Maybe I'm just imagining things.
Mmm. I thought we could do some party games after, but I don't think you're quite up for it...
It's a shame, but let's call it good for today. I'll try to think of something everyone can enjoy next time.
This concludes our test of courage. Thanks, everyone! That is all!
