It turned out great. 
Hehehe, it's perfect. 
Hey, guys? Could you try this for us?
What do you want? We'll be opening the store soon.
My, what a lovely cake. You want us to taste this?
I'm pretty confident about this one. 
That sounds promising. I'd be happy to try it.
Very well. I will not mince words if it's bad.
There wouldn't be any point in you trying it if you didn't.
Let us try it, then. 
Thank you very much... Hmm... 
Wh-What do you think?
...It's good. The way the chocolate melts in my mouth is exquisite. 
I can taste the walnuts, but what's making the texture so soft and elastic?
Marshmallows. 
A fascinating choice. Not only does it look nice, but the cake's textures are diverse and spread in your mouth. I simply cannot have enough of this cake.
It has a very subtle sweetness to it. I believe even those who do not have much of a sweet tooth will enjoy it.
Indeed. It's a perfect cake. I would love to put it on our menu immediately. 
We did it, Onii-chan!
We sure did, Nono!
Why are both of you cheering?
We actually thought of this cake together. 
We formed a study group and tried out all sorts of ideas. This was one of them.
A study group...? You should've told me you were doing something so wonderful.
I'll be sure to let you know next time.
That's a promise, yes?
...I see now. This isn't just your cake, Yanushi-kun...
Do you mind if we put this cake up for sale?
As I said before, I wouldn't mind adding this to the menu.
I see no reason to refuse.
Yay!
Let's make it the cake of the day, then.
Very well. 
Are we done? We're short on time, so let's go back to work.
Yeah!
