Phew, that was a good bath. 
We'd worked our butts off today.
I had dinner, took a bath, and now it was time for some much-needed rest.
It was still pretty early, though... Maybe I should play some video games for a change of pace, or skim through the culinary magazine I bought...
While I was weighing my options, there was a knock at the door.
Mmm? Come in. 
Yanushi-kun. 
Hana came into my room.
Hey. What's up? It's pretty late.
...!
Haah...!
S-Sorry... 
What are you apologizing for? 
I wasn't entirely sure, to be honest.
Y-You had a scary look on your face...
I'm not mad at you, Yanushi-kun... 
Who are you mad at, then?
Makoto, of course! Even though you don't belong to any of us...
Huh...?
She said this earlier.
Understand, Hana? Never forget that Yanushi-kun belongs to me and no one else.
Unforgivable! Grrrrr...!
"Grr," huh...
It seemed Hana, who was furiously clenching her fists, wasn't in the position of listening to a word I said.
That didn't sound like something Makoto would say, though.
Don't you think you're assuming too much, Hana?
Are you siding with Makoto, Yanushi-kun?
No, that's not what I... 
When it came to her rivalry with Makoto, Hana was something else... 
Yanushi-kun!
Ah...?!
Hana drew her face close to mine.
She shouted at me again... or so I thought. 
However, her stern expression quickly crumbled.
From your perspective, between me and Makoto, who do you find more attractive?
She asked, sounding as though she were on the verge of tears.
Th-That's... 
I was at a loss for words.
Sorry... I've been so caught up with baking, I hadn't really put much thought into it...
It was like that back in Kyoto, too. 
The three of us were always together, and... Hana was always fighting with Makoto over me. 
They asked me back then, "Which one of us would you choose?" Even then, I couldn't answer.
Yes... I suppose that makes sense... 
Hm...?
Hana nodded to herself for some reason. 
You're having trouble deciding, right?
Y-Yeah, well... 
I will help you make up your mind. 
What...?
If I make it clear just how attractive I am, I'm sure it'll blow away all your doubts!
She proudly puffed out her chest and crept closer to me.
Huh? What...?!
