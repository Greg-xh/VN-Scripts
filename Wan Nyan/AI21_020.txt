After the meeting ended, we engaged in idle chatter as we made our way to our respective stores.
But really, Sensei has always been so cool and efficient. She's got this mature, womanly feel to her! Ahaha...
I wish I could be that kind of woman... Don't you feel the same way?
I do! She's the ideal mature woman.
Totally, to-tal-ly! I wanna be like her someday... That's probably impossible for me, but I still wanna try!
I agree. That firm resolve of hers is quite lovely.
She's beautiful and refined, too... Strong and beautiful. That seems to define her perfectly, I'd say.
Quite right. We should follow her example. She is reminiscent of a samurai... No, a handsome knight.
I've got to work hard, too! I'll train and keep aspiring to improve. After all, it's best to strive for more.
Right. I've got to try my best, too... 
I don't really idolize her the same way, but I just hope she doesn't think I'm some sort of nuisance...
Just making tasty sweets wasn't enough when you managed your own store. It doesn't matter what your position is within the company; it takes a lot of different sets of skills.
Nee-san's words were true and apt, was all I could say. 
Everyone here was talented and beautiful in their own way, but they all seemed to yearn to be more like Nee-san.
(Each day requires discipline, training, learning, and study... I've got a long road ahead of me.)
We had to keep it together. In my case, I needed to become the kind of man Nee-san would approve of... That's how I felt about it, anyway.
