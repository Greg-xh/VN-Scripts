The next morning...
Nnn, uhh... 
After breakfast, I changed into my street clothes and waited outside the dorms for Hana.
Since we lived in the same dorm and had breakfast together, it made sense to leave at the same time.
Hana insisted I wait for her outside, though.
It probably worked out better this way as someone, Makoto or otherwise, could mistake it for a date.
Woof, woof!
Ah, there she is. 
I heard Romeo's barking and turned to look in the direction of his voice. As expected, Romeo and Hana were... Huh?
I apologize for the wait, it took me a while to get ready. 
...
Having said that, Hana averted her gaze shyly.
I've seen that outfit before. If I recall, this was Hana's favorite getup. Something about it felt off, though...
Her clothes looked tighter than before, especially around the chest... This only further accentuated her curves.
And her makeup looked more mature than usual... 
She wasn't wearing much makeup, but what little she did have on made her gorgeous features much more pronounced.
...
H-Hmm, it's a little... awkward when you stare at me like that. Did I mess it up? 
I'm usually in the kitchen, and having makeup on in front of the customers might be rude... I'm not very good at applying it, either.
N-No, it's pretty, really pretty! Yup, you look great!
I'm glad to hear you say that. Inviting you out today was a good idea.
I could smell a sweet, gentle aroma wafting from her as she spoke. Was that perfume? It was a pleasant scent, fitting for a girl whose name meant "Flower."
Let's go, Yanushi-kun. Romeo's getting impatient with me!
Woof, woof!
...Ah, yeah. Sure. Let's head out.
Romeo and I walked alongside Hana, who smiled softly at us. This was just a walk in the park...
...So then why was I so anxious and excited?
