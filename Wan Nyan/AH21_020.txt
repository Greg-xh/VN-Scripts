...
Good job, everyone. I'm off.
Good work today!
Just... don't push yourself too hard.
Thanks.
Sheesh. 
It had been a busy and dramatic day.
Despite it all, my heart felt full and I wasn't sure why.
I was certain the new tarte was good enough as it was.
Senpai and the others liked it. More importantly, the chairwoman said it was delicious and gave her seal of approval.
However, the cake the chairwoman made weighed heavily on my mind.
I wanted to eat it, but I doubt the chairwoman would make it if I asked her for it.
Which meant I'd have to make something better than the tarte, and use it as a bargaining chip against the chairwoman to get her to make a cake for me.
That realization lit a fire under me.
When I thought of it that way, I was absolutely beside myself.
I turned the stove back on, preparing to melt the butter in the pot in front of me...
