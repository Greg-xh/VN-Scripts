Okay, let's do our best today!
Yes!
Huh, where's Onii-chan and Nekodomari-san?
Morning! 
Good morning!
Yes, good morning. Both of you are late? You weren't at breakfast this morning, either.
Er, about that...
We obviously couldn't leave the kitchen like that after having sex, so we cleaned up and went back to our dorm rooms.
It was only after everyone had gone for breakfast that we could launder our clothes. That was pretty nerve-racking...
...I, uh, overslept. Ahaha. Same goes for you, right, Makoto?
Mhm. I had a dream where I had sex with Kenta at the Kitty Parlor... Just the two of us. Hehe.
Makoto...!
N-Nekodomari-san! You musn't do something so indecent! Especially not in the store. That's a no-go!
Calm down, Shinono-chan. It was just a dream.
You can't help it if it's in a dream... Kenta-kun, you're not allowed to do naughty things in Makoto's dreams anymore, okay?
Gotcha... It really was a dream, though. Ahaha...
Even in her dreams...
She's right! You're not allowed to do it, even in someone's dreams!
...Yes, ma'am. 
Heehee.
Makoto giggled and watched the exchange between Senpai and me. Was she trying to give me a heart attack?
Okay, time for work! Kenta-kun, Makoto-chan, did you prepare everything for today's dessert? We'll be serving...
St. Honor｣ cake. It uses cream puffs and a pie for a base. I think we can come up with some great ideas if we work together.
Mhm! I'll leave it to you two. Let's do our best today!
We're not gonna lose to you guys! See ya, Onii-chan!
Makoto closed the gap between us after Senpai and Nono left the room.
That was a risky thing to say, Makoto...
You don't want them to know? I don't mind.
Having sex in the store is pretty bad.
Oh, you meant that... So I can say us being a couple isn't just a dream, right?
Now, listen he_Huh?!
Muha!
She just... kissed me? And used her tongue, too...
Muha, mmm... Nnn...
Buha! M-Makoto?! What if something's watching?!
I don't mind. That wasn't just a normal kiss, though. I was tasting you. Your lips have a gentle flavor to them...
They have a flavor?
Heehee. Let's get working on that cake. I'm not losing today. 
I'm not gonna roll over and lose, either.
...
Makoto and I loved making sweets... and probably loved each other, too.
Get your head out of the clouds, Kenta!
I know!
...
Woof?
U-Uuuugh! Smooching! Th-They were smooching! That Makoto, that Makoto... I'm so jealous!
Woof?
N-Not jealous, more appalled. I'm appalled at how indecent she is! I don't mean I want to... with Yanushi-kun... Uuu, I'm jealous, I'm so jealouuuus!
Muuau...
