Nn... Mmmm... 
(I'm the first one up. Everyone else is fast asleep.)
(I've still got some time left. Maybe I should go back to sleep?)
(I'm already up, though. Going back to sleep would be a huge waste.)
(Oh! I've got a great idea!)
(Hehehe... Peeking in on Onii-chan while he's sleeping is a perfect idea, if I do say so myself!)
(I get to stare at him for as long as I want, and then I can wake him up for a nice, long chat.)
(And if he wakes up on his own, I'll chat with him anyway. It's the perfect plan!)
(I haven't forgiven Onii-chan for forgetting our promise, but I feel kinda bad for not being my usual, cute self...)
(So maybe compromising for once is a good idea...)
(A-Anyway, maybe he'll remember our promise if we spend more time together!)
(With that, this plan is officially flawless!)
(Just you wait, Onii-chan. Nono's coming for you!)
