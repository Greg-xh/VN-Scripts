Nn, nnn... 
I woke up, convinced I'd heard my alarm clock, and slapped the covers blindly in search of it.
There it is... Aah... Fuhaaaa...
I somehow recovered the alarm clock from overhead and recalled finding Makoto here yesterday.
...
...She's not here.
I quickly glanced at the clock after that thought passed vacantly through my mind. I'd apparently woken up a bit earlier than usual.
Right... I forgot to set my alarm before I went to bed. 
...Aaah. Should I go back to bed?
...
Uh, I don't feel like it. At times like this...
The better course of action would be to either get up and move around, or think about cakes.
I got out of bed and went to the Kitty Parlor's kitchen.
