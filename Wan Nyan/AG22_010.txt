Hmm... Haah... Phew...
The following day, I immediately got to work after we finished getting the store ready to open. However, my mind was still a million miles away.
I was up all night racking my brain, but I couldn't come up with a reason as to why Michiyo-san hated me.
Thanks to that, I'd stand still and start sighing like crazy if I let my mind wander for even a moment. That sort of behavior was unacceptable; I had to stay focused!
("...I refuse to evaluate someone who gives up halfway through," huh...? What did I do...?)
It was probably something big if it made her this angry.
She didn't say I was annoying or bothersome, but that she couldn't forgive or acknowledge me.
...
Nothing immediately came to mind, but I doubt it was something I said. Perhaps I had done something that made her hold a grudge.
...Yanushi-kun? Are you all right? You look like you're in pain... 
Huh? Ah, yeah, I'm fine. I've got something on my mind, sorry. 
...I see. If you feel under the weather, just say so, yes? 
Thanks, Hana. Sorry for worrying you. 
I'd worried her... I needed to stop thinking about this, otherwise I'd weigh everyone down.
(At this rate, I'll keep agonizing over it forever... All right, I'll ask Michiyo-san about it one more time...!)
This had gone on long enough. If I let my mind wander, I'd stop working and would only worry the others.
I'd ask her myself later, and apologize if I'd done something to offend her without noticing.
I'd explain myself if it ended up being a misunderstanding on Michiyo-san's part, too. Her hating me over something as silly as a misunderstanding would be terrible.
...Okay!
For now, I would focus on work. That was the most important thing right now.
Later, when I take my break, I would set aside a time with Michiyo-san so we could talk alone and clear the air...
