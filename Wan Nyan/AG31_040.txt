Hmmhmmhmm, mmhmm... Your friendly neighborhood chairwoman, out on patrol! Hmhm~@
...Wait, what? The storeroom door is wide open! That's annoyin'...
It's weird for the door to be unlocked, but jeez! Whoever left it open is such a ditz.
Right, time to bust out my special, handy dandy master key to close the door... Muahaha!
Jeez, talk about careless. Ya gotta make sure to lock up!
I'm always on the ball with stuff like this, hehe. I'm the chairwoman who defines all chairwomen!
Time to check out the rest of the campus. Looks like my nightly patrols are necessary! Mmmhmm, mmhmmhmm~
