Not that I had much choice, I escorted Hana as she took Romeo on a walk.
Ohohoh! Come now, Romeo. I'll throw the ball, so go get it! 
Woof, woof!
Hah!
Woof! 
Romeo broke off into a sprint, chasing after the ball Hana threw. Her sizeable breasts bounced as she tossed it.
Heheheh.
Yanushi-kun, are you really okay? It doesn't hurt anywhere, right?
No, the pain's mostly gone by now... 
Does that mean... you're thinking about Makoto?
Huh?! Ah, not really...! 
I don't mind if you think about her, but I do want you to look at me more. 
Hana...?
Makoto's my childhood friend, rival, and neighbor from across the street. We may have gotten along when we were little... but, deep down, we're enemies!
Really?
Yes, though I might be the only one who sees it that way... 
...?
It annoys me to admit it, but Makoto does have a lead on me right now. I'll have the upper hand before too much longer, though!
There's something I don't intend to give up on, so make sure to watch me, too, okay?
...Yeah, sorry.
