Mmmm...
...Hm? Huh? Why isn't my alarm going off...?
No, wait... Wait a second... I only felt this sluggish when I've slept for too long...
Hey! What time is it...?
Gulp...!
I tossed the blanket aside and checked the nearby clock.
Whoa! It's past 10AM! 
I cried out with surprise, then looked at the date...
Ah... Oh, today's my day off...
I heaved a heavy sigh, crawled out of bed, and went to wash my face.
All right... What should I do today...?
Surely there were other young people who meticulously planned their days off, but I had nothing but free time on my hands and nothing to use it on.
Hmm... I guess I'll follow every other young persons' example and take a walk around town. Maybe catch a movie or something...
And just as I whispered that to myself...
Hm? Yeah, come in.
Good... morning, Yanushi-kun?
Oh, good morning! 
Y-Yes... Aaah... Hmm... U-Um...?
Hana's faced was flushed bright red and her eyes were darting about the room.
H-Hey... What's wrong...?
She was likely conscious of me after what had happened... or something. She was so awkward, even I was starting to feel uncomfortable.
U-Um... Actually, I... Um, haven't been here for long and I'm not very familiar with the area...
Y-Yeah...?
My mouth hung open as I struggled to understand what she was trying to say.
So, um... I'm not really sure where I can shop around here...
O-Oh... 
So, I... Uh, I thought maybe I'd go out shopping today...
Hm? I see... Right, want me to come with you?
Huh...?! W-Would you? 
Sure, it's only shopping. 
Ha... Haha...! That's an "okay," right?! You just agreed to go with me, right?!
Hana giggled excitedly and puffed out her chest with glee.
Y-Yeah... It's okay?
Roger that! Now that you've agreed, I'll allow you to escort me!
Ah... Right... 
If this were a manga, a sweatdrop would surely appear over my head.
Ohohoh! Let us depart and shop for spring clothes, then! Ohohohoh...!
Ahahaha.... W-Wait up... Let me change first. 
I called out to Hana as she walked away victoriously and changed into my street clothes.
