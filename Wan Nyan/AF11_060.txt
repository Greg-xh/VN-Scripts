Was that okay...?
I called out to Hana, who had been sitting on the bed with her back to me.
I-It... It was fine! 
She replied with her usual, harsh tone.
Ugh... 
I figured she'd be embarrassed, but it still hurt.
Any guy would feel depressed if the girl he just slept with gave him the cold shoulder. I was, of course, that guy in this particular scenario...
Did I do something wrong? Had I gone too far and done something I shouldn't have?
W-Wait a second... I wasn't too small, was I...?!
Ah... er, ooh...
Uh... I'm sorry. Um...
Huh?
I showed... you a rather shameful side of myself today...
Hehe...
I couldn't help but laugh when Hana hung her head.
Wh...?! Why are you...?! 
There was nothing shameful about it. Besides...
Pat, pat... 
I softly patted Hana's hair with the palm of my hand. 
...?!
I'm happy... I got to see all of you. 
Aaaaaaaaaah!
Hana's face flushed bright red once again...
You... dummy...!
...and turned her back to me.
U-Um... Yanushi-kun?
Yes?
Hana's voice grew sweeter upon hearing my timid reply.
I, um... I'm not going to be the kind of girl who insists on acting like your girlfriend...
I wanted you to know how I felt, and I don't expect you to take responsibility for making my wish come true.
Hana...
However, if I can be a bit selfish for a moment... I hope you'll think of me a little more going forward...
Hana...!
Fwoop...!
Hana suddenly stood up from the bed.
Aha! Ahahahaha!  Wh-What... What am I saying? 
S-Sweet dreams, then! 
With a bashful smile on her face, Hana quickly put on her clothes and scampered out of the room.
Now that I was alone...
My foggy, disoriented mind replayed just how embarrassed Hana had been.
And I was suddenly struck with the realization that I would no longer be thinking of just cakes, but of Hana, too...
