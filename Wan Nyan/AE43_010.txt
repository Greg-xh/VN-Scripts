Mm... Mmn... Huh?
Aaah... I conked out hard... Ah, yeah. It's already noon.
I must've been really tired if I slept that long.
Not like that was a bad thing, though. I wouldn't be able to do my job if I didn't replenish my stamina.
At this rate, I'll be able to give it my all at work tomorrow!
With that, what do I do today now that I'm raring to go?
Should I just stay in and relax all day or go out somewhere...? Hmm...
Regardless, I'd better wash up and get something to eat first.
