Good morning! 
Oh, you're up early today. 
Our mornin' briefing doesn't start for another thirty minutes. Did ya get your times messed up?
Just woke up early today. I had nothing better to do, so I came here.
...It's good to wake up early, but you've got bags under your eyes.
Ooh lala, you're right! It's not that ya woke up early, but more like ya never slept at all!
Ahaha... I had trouble falling asleep.
Pulling all-nighters, even at your age, isn't a good idea. How are you going to serve customers when you look like that?
I'll wash my face before we open.
So, why were ya up so late? No way were ya studyin'!
You know me so well!
That's not something you should be proud of.
I had a lot on my mind and, before I knew it, it was morning.
You were probably thinking of some new recipe. 
Hmm. Since you two are older and wiser than me, may I ask a question?
It sounds annoyin', but I'll try and listen.
What's your question, then?
Well, has there ever been a time when you couldn't stop thinking about someone? Like, wondering what they were doing, or if they had nice dreamsｩ
Just thinking about them makes you happy and you can't help but smile. At the same time, you feel lonely and want to see them...
You want to see their face, hear their voice and make them laugh, and you think about them so much you forget to sleep. Has that ever happened to you?
Nope, never. 
How about you, Nee-san?
Me? Well... is that why you had trouble sleeping last night?
Well, yeah. I don't know why, though. I've never felt this way before, and I'm kind of worried.
Why... Don't you know?
Would I be asking if I did?
Ahaha! I don't have any experience with it myself, but{W:700} everyone{W:0} knows what that means! Even an eternal virgin like Fuumin gets it.
Tch...
Wait... Please don't look at me with those murderous eyes! I'll wet myself!
Please tell me if you know what it is, Nee-san.
Jeez... You're completely ignorant when it comes to anything but sweets, aren't you?
It's not like you're some big expert on the subject.
Madam Chairwoman, please shut your damn mouth.
Okay. I'll be quiet for a bit...
Ahem... Anyway, Yanushi. This is just conjecture, but I believe the phenomenon you're describing is "love."
Hehehehe! Conjecture and phenomenon?! You're such a dork, Fuumin!
Didn't I tell you to shut your damn mouth?
I was quiet for a little bit.
Wait a second... Love? What are you talking about?
Hehehe! Dorkiness must run in the family. She's talkin' about romantic love. Infatuation, amour!
Love? Y-You mean{W:700} that{W:0} kind of love?!
Call it what ya want, but that's probably it.
No, no, no. I was fine until yesterday morning, so it can't just happen out of nowhere like that... 
That's how it works. It bonks ya over the head when ya least expect it! Hmph!
You're looking awfully smug for someone who has never been in love.
You're the last person I wanna hear that from, Fuumin!
In any event, are you really in love, Yanushi?
Aah, I don't really know how to answer that right now...
Such an annoyin' boy! By the way, I've got somethin' to tell ya!
What is it?
To be honest, ya always looked pretty cute to me, so I'll tell ya now! I'm in love with ya!
Wha?!
Huh? Oh, hmm, thanks. 
Bzzzt! What a crappy reaction! Ya don't look at all excited that a cutie like me just confessed!
I'm sorry. I can't reciprocate those feelings, Madam Chairwoman.
Ugh! He turned me down! He threw me to the curb!
Just kiddin'! Did my fake confession surprise ya?
What the hell were you thinking...?
Be real with me, how did it feel to get confessed to?
How did it feel...? It was like, "Oh, is that right?"
I know it was fake, but that really hurts!
Sorry. 
Now, try imagin' the girl ya like saying that, and then askin' ya to be her boyfriend!
How do I...?
Just imagine it. C'mon, go, go, go!
It's not difficult to imagine since she's already said it at least a dozen times... But here goes nothing!
Hmmm...
I love you... Please, go out with me!
!!!
Whoa... What was this feeling? I'm so happy... Happier than I've ever been and could ever hope to describe!
My heart raced and my body felt warm.
Looks like that's a bingo!
What?
It's totally love! That grin on your face tells me everythin' I need to know!
H-Huh? A grin?
You're definitely grinnin'! It's the biggest grin ever! Isn't that right, Fuumin?
That's quite a perverted look in your eyes. I can't believe how sloven your expression is right now.
Anyway, that settles it. You're in love, Kenta-kun!
I'm... in love?
