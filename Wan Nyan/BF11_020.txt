This place sure feels creepy...
...
Hana. Heeey, Earth to Hana.
Huh? Wh-What is it?
It feels creepy enough for something to pop out, is all.
I agree... It does seem as though someone could jump out from behind every corner...
Right? Senpai said there weren't any jumpscares, but I'm sure those who don't cope well with scary places would easily freak out.
That's quite right...
Um... Are you one of those kinds of people, Hana?
...I'm ashamed to admit it, but I was only acting tough in front of Makoto and have been shaking ever since we left.
You should've said something sooner!
I was too embarrassed. Being afraid of ghosts at my age is...
I actually think it's cute.
Cute?
It's pretty girly. 
I'm happy to hear you say that...
If you're that scared, do you want me to hold your hand?
Wh-What?! M-My hand?
I've heard it can have a relaxing effect on the nerves.
You don't have to if you don't want to, though.
N-No! Of course I want to... Please, hold my hand! 
In that case... 
Ah...
Sorry, was that too tight?
I-It's fine... 
Okay, then. Did that help calm you down at all?
It may take a me a bit to relax, but I'm not as scared anymore... My heart is beating really fast for other reasons, actually...
I don't get it... Anyway, if you're feeling better, let's go.
Yes.
