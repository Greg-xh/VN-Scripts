For how lively it had been, the silence felt incredibly heavy now that I was alone.
It was still too early to go to bed, but I couldn't just walk over to the girls' room after talking with them for so long.
Maybe I should watch TV in the dining hall? Then again, I wasn't much of a TV person.
Mm... Some fresh air would probably do me some good.
It's been nice and chilly lately. Perfect for a nighttime walk.
Onii-chan. 
Nono? What are you doing here? 
I noticed you were taking a walk, so I followed you.
Where are you going? Mind if I tag along?
I don't mind, but I won't be out here much longer.
That's okay! I love going on walks!
Even when we were kids, you'd always follow me around wherever I went. Do you like going on walks that much?
That's right... I like...
Are you okay? Your face is really red.
You're just seeing things. Let's get going!
Sure, let's go.
Mhm!
Wanna take a break? 
This really takes me back... We used to play here all the time with Onee-chan.
You remember that?
Of course. I'd never forget that.
Heheh... 
What are you smiling about?
I'm really happy that it's finally just the two of us, is all.
Oh, right. It's been a while since we were alone together...
Yes, exactly! You always had someone practically glued to you.
I hadn't seen everyone in forever. It sounds like they really missed me.
I missed you, too! I missed you more than they did!
I figured... You were only in third grade when you had to move to France because of your dad's job, right?
Yeah. You never answered any of my letters or returned my calls! I was really lonely!
I'm sorry... That was never my intention. Try to keep your chin up, okay?
Jeez, stop treating me like a little kid! You're dead wrong if you think a head pat is going to get you off the hook!
Right, you're definitely not a kid anymore... You've turned into a fine young woman.
H-Huh? Oh yeah? You really think so?
Sure, you've gotten taller and matured quite nicely, too.
Do you think I'm pretty?
Of course. I think I'd put you more in the "cute" category, though.
Which do you prefer, Onii-chan? Pretty girls or cute girls? 
I think both are good, but you're perfect just the way you are.
Heehee... I see.
You never cease to amaze me, Nono.
Did I do something?
I had no idea you enrolled in PochiTama.
Nee-san taught both of us how to bake, but I didn't think you were that serious about it.
It piqued my interest once I got in Paris.
That's amazing, though. If you got picked to take the Candidate Exam, that means you're{W:700} really{W:0} good.
You have to be the top student at the Paris branch, if nothing else.
Heehee, I worked really hard! 
It's a pretty big deal, and not something you can pull off with just a little hard work.
You really gave it your all, didn't you? I'm so proud.
Heehee... 
It's all because of PochiTama that we were reunited.
Yup.
I'm glad we got to meet again... Welcome home, Nono. 
I'm back, Onii-chan. 
How's Paris? Are you getting along with everyone there? 
I've got tons of friends, and every day's a blast.
I'm glad to hear it. To be honest, I was always kind of worried about you.
How come?
You were inconsolable at the airport. Everyone was worried.
...Huh?
You even threw a tantrum and refused to get on the plane. I always wondered how well things were going for you over there...
You remembered all that?
Yeah, of course I do.
Th-Then... do you remember the promise we made?
A promise? Did I say something like that? I don't remember. 
Onii-chan, you nincompoop! 
Ninco... Nono, what? 
I can't believe you! You can remember everything else, but forget the most important part?! 
Did I really promise you something that important?
You did, and it was the kind of promise that changed my entire life!
It was? Hmmm... What was it again...?
Hey, what did I promise you?
There's no point if I tell you!
Hmmm...
Sorry, I really can't remember what it was...
Onii-chan, you nincompoop! 
Those girls were fawning all over you, so why should you care about our promise?!
I{W:700} do{W:0} care!
But you don't remember it, right?
Y-Yeah...
I noticed you and Nekohana-san get along pretty well...
Well, it's only because Senpai and I have been together for a long time...
Huuuh?! Are you two dating?!
That's not what I meant. We've known each other from when we were in school.
You were in different grades, right?
We were on the same committee, so we hit it off and became friends.
Hmmm... So there's really nothing going on between you two?
What do you mean by "nothing"? 
It's fine if you don't get it.
...If you say so. 
I do say so!
Man, girls are so complicated...
I'm not complicated at all! I'm simple! 
Ahaha... Let's keep going, okay? 
You know I'm mad at you, right?
Well, yeah. I just don't know{W:700} why{W:0} you're mad.
I'll be happier when you remember the promise we made.
It's hard when you put me on the spot like that.
In that case, I won't be your cute little sister until you do!
Please, no... I want us to get along, Nono.
Do you really want that?
Of course I do. You're special to me.
I... I guess I have no choice, then. You're still on thin ice, though!
I understand. I'll try to remember our promise as soon as I can. 
You better!
Well, now that we've got that covered, let's go. 
Hey, Onii-chan. 
Yes?
Can I hold your hand?
Sure. Here.
Your hand is so big and warm... 
It is?
Mhm...
