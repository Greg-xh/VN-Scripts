Good job today, everyone. 
Yeah, good work. 
Having Kenta around has really been a huge help.
Really? You were all working so hard. I'm sure you'd be fine without me.
No, no. Your efforts make it easier for us to focus on our work.
It's like Hinana-chan said, we can keep an eye on all the little things around here because of you.
Totally agreed. 
Er, I'm glad I could be of help.
The Kitty Parlor really does need you, Kenta. Come help us more often, got it?
That's a great idea! Please come back!
I'd love to work with you more, too. 
Thanks, everyone. I'll keep that in mind.
I'm looking forward to when you say "Yes."
I've been on my feet all day and my tummy's growling. Are we ready to go back to the dorms?
Yeah, let's go wash up.
Oh, I think I'll stick around for a bit. 
Me, too. 
Are you two staying overtime?
S-Something like that. 
All right. We're heading out, then.
Bye-bye.
Ready to get started?
Sure!
Looking good! You really are amazing, Kenta-kun. 
You're doing great, too, Senpai! You keep throwing out all sorts of unique ideas that I never would have considered.
They're not that good... 
That's not true at all. If nothing else, I was surprised by how good they all were!
Heehee, I'm really happy to hear you say that. You're like a teacher to me, y'know?
Really? Me, your teacher?
Yeah. I wanted to become a p｡tissi｢re after trying one of the cakes you made.
I'll never forget it. All of the cakes you made for me were so good, I just fell in love with the taste.
I'm here today because of those very cakes, so you really are like a teacher to me.
No way, I'm way too inexperienced to be your teacher... I'm sorry.
You've got nothing to apologize for. I'm just grateful to you. 
It's kinda awkward when you say it like that...
You might not know it, but you've given me so much. So many irreplaceable things...
Thanks for being with me today. 
I, er... I want to thank you for this, somehow...
You don't have to. It was a learning experience for the both of us, so we're even.
N-No. I want to show you how grateful I am... Please accept it...
Huh? Are you going to give me something?
Well, not exactly, but... Do you not want it? It's okay if you don't, but...
It's not that I don't want it, but... 
Th-Then, it's okay... Right?
If you're okay with it, I guess...?
O-Of course I am! 
All right, then... Sorry for the trouble.
Don't be! Well, hmm... Can you, um... Can you take off your pants?
Excuse me?
