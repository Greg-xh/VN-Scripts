Mmm, it's great! It turned out delicious! 
Today's fried chicken came out perfectly, if I do say so myself. Leaving it to marinate in the sauce since this morning was the right choice.
I worked my butt off today, so I was starved. Time to replenish all that lost energy!
Haha. Guys really know how to put food away, huh?
Oh, hey there, Senpai. 
Hello. You've got some rice on your cheek.
Ahaha... Jeez, that's embarrassing.
By the way, I heard about your new cake. It sold really well, right?
It's the best selling cake we've ever made.
That's amazing. Our cakes do pretty well, but yours must be{W:700} that{W:0} good.
I bet it's tasty, too.
It is. I can actually say that with absolute certainty.
It's unusual for you to praise something so much. I'm really interested now.
If you'd like, you're always welcome to try it.
Really?! I'd love to! 
If it's for you, I'll do it in a heartbeat. 
And, uhm... If you don't mind, can you teach me the recipe after the exams are over? 
I want to try making such a tasty cake sometime, too.
Sure, no probｩ
Onii-chan!
Nono, why are you shouting?
Forget that and just come here! 
Wait u_Okay, I'm coming! Don't pull on me.
Hurry up!
What's gotten into you? Sorry, Senpai, I'll see you later. 
R-Right.
Come on already! 
All right, all right. 
...What was that about?
