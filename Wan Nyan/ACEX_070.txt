Phew. You're gutsier than I thought you'd be. Pervier, too.
Was that really okay, though? You ended up skipping class.
I'll beg Nee-san and ask for a catch-up day later. I can't be the only one held back, right?
Heheh, right. It wouldn't look good for my partner to be held back. 
If you end up not having enough credits to graduate, let me know, okay? I know a place you can work at.
You do?
It's a little shop in Kyoto called Nekonoya. You get three meals a day, and a bonus afternoon nap with the daughter and store heiress.
Hmm, well... I guess I'll need to work hard so I can graduate.
Hmm. What does that mean? 
Not much, really. 
Jeez, Kenta!
Getting jealous, angry, and happy with one another...
I had to graduate so Makoto would stay by my side.
And, in order to achieve that, I had to work hard on my supplementary lessons, as well on the practical exam at Beans Puppy and the Kitty Parlor. Together with everyone... No, together with Makoto!
