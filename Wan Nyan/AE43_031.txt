Hehehe...
You look happy. 
It just felt that good!
I agree. So good, in fact, my knees feel kind of shaky.
Do you like having sex with me?
Huh? Well, uh. Yeah, I do.
I love having sex with you, too. 
You were a virgin only a short time ago, but you've already become a huge pervert.
I didn't mean it that way!
What did you mean, then?
I like how everything feels when we have sex.
So it{W:700} is{W:0} about the sex.
It's not! I didn't mean for that to sound lewd.
Your warm body, the way you breathe, and knowing how much you cherish me... Feeling all of that makes me happy!
It's so nice, but feeling your body makes me even happier.
I see. I think I feel the same way. 
Really?
Your voice and gestures somehow feel really precious to me...
Precious...? 
You feel so much and want me more than anything... That part of you is so adorable.
Onii-chan... 
To backtrack a little, can you please forgive me now?
Yeah, I can. We're good now.
Good. I'm so glad... I really am relieved.
Let's go on out on a date now that we've made up, okay?
Not like I have anything else planned. I was just going to hang out in my room. I'd rather spend time with you!
Great! Then it's a date. 
Right. Let's go!
Yep!
