W-We're finally back... 
W-We're safe! We made it back alive...!
Are you okay? You're as white as a ghost.
Of course we're not...!
It was hell. Only a true monster could concoct such a devious scheme for their own amusement...
A monster...? Ahahaha...
It was a quick round trip, yet you're petrified. You're such adorable little things.
If you find that cute, then they can't compete with you, Hana. You were scared stiff the whole way.
C-Could you refrain from spreading such slander?!
Really? So you being so talkative back there{W:700} wasn't{W:0} because you were trying to hide how scared you were?
I was simply being considerate, as I assumed you would be scared!
Oh, really? Your voice being all high-pitched was just my ears playing tricks on me, then.
Your fear must've made you imagine things!
I thought I was going to die... Uuugh...
I... don't think I'll be able to go to the bathroom alone tonight...
Do not feel ashamed... I feel the same way...
That bad, huh...? I feel kinda sorry for you... 
I thought we could do some party games after, but I don't think you're quite up for it...
It's a shame, but let's call it good for today. I'll try to think of something everyone can enjoy next time.
Please do...
