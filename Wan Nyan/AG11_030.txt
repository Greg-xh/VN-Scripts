Ah... There she is... 
...
I timidly entered the dining hall at Hina's encouragement and found Michiyo-san watching TV.
(I never took her for someone who liked television... Given her serious nature, she's likely the type who becomes fully absorbed by it.)
(All right, this is my chance... I'll quietly walk up to her and maybe we can try out Hina's touchy-feely idea...!)
U-Um...!
...Ah.
I smiled awkwardly and slightly lifted up my hands.
Wh-Why, hello there, Michiyo-san! Great work today!
...What do you want?
Right, it's-a-me! You must be tired from work today, Michiyo-san. I might not look it, but I'm a whiz when it comes to massages. Want me to give your shoulders a little rub?
...Huh?
Don't be shy, we're friends and colleagues, after all! Just relax your muscles and it'll help you feel more restful for tomorrow!
You're a serious, hardworking employee, so I'm sure you're exhausted... Sleep and a bath aren't enough sometimes!
We can do more than just your shoulders, if you'd like! I could massage every nook and cranny... No need to be shy, let me help you clear away all fatigue...
Stay away and don't touch me, you knave! Do you want me to break every bone in your body and send you to the hospital?!
Aah... 
I lost all my nerve after being mowed down by Michiyo-san's fiery aura. I was so terrified, I couldn't move.
It felt as if I'd been flicked on the forehead by an unseen hand, like an invisible blade slashed at me. 
Hmph! Begone, fool! If you don't want to get hurt, get out of my sight...
I-I'm sorry... I'm sorry! I'm really sorry...! 
I couldn't even think up an excuse. I fled the scene dejectedly, with my shoulders dropped. 
Wh-What a... sleezy, perverted man! Yes, he's a pervert...!
