I'll be heading back to my room now.
Ah, Nono!
What is it, Onii-chan?
I swear I'll remember our promise!
You're making a promise about a promise?
Yeah. I'm sorry I'm making you wait, but just give me a little more time. 
All right, I understand. 
Good night, then.
Nighty night. 
I can't put this off any longer. I have to try my hardest to remember our promise!
