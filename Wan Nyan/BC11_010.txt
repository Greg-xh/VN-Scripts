All right, let's go with this!
Um...?
Rejoice. I'm your partner. 
Cool, let's have fun. 
That goes without saying. 
Objection! I suspect you cheated so you could be Yanushi-kun's partner!
I'll pretend you didn't just blurt out how I felt about him right to Kenta's face.
No need to be so condescending!
Think back for a second. In the entire time we've known each other, have I{W:700} ever{W:0} cheated on anything?
If something like that{W:700} had{W:0} happened, I certainly don't remember it. I could be wrong, though.
If there ever was one, you're welcome to be Kenta-kun's partner instead.
Wha...?!
Well, what's the verdict?
...There was not. I'm sorry for making false accusations.
That's good. I wouldn't want you to become the kind of person that talks about people behind their backs.
Ugh... How pathetic.
If everyone's done partnering up, then team one should go first.
Let's go, Kenta.
All right!
