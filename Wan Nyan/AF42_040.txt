Hmm...
Hana left the dorms and ran toward the store.
Why was she going there this late at night...?
With the front door closed, I entered through the back.
...!
Hana was standing in the kitchen and whipping cream with a determined look on her face.
Hana... What are you doing?
Huh? Ah, Yanushi-kun?
Don't "Yanushi-kun?" me. You're going to make a cake this late?
Yes. For some reason, I've got all of this pent up energy...
You always look energetic to me. 
Well, now moreso than ever! I can't let all this energy go to waste, and I'm sure I'll come up with something.
Hmm...
I couldn't help but admire her.
Aren't you tired? You don't have to stick around...
Hana said, kneading mix into batter. 
Hm... Might as well stick around and watch.
I see... In that case, keep your eyes peeled. Until the moment I defeat Makoto... 
Mmm? Didn't you make up with Makoto?
Make up with her? We weren't fighting. 
But she acknowledged you. 
Well, yes, and that made me happy. But I don't like that condescending attitude of hers!
Ahaha... 
No matter what she says and where we wind up, Makoto is still a goal for me.
Even if she tells me to stop, I can't just sit back and accept that.
Hana continued to knead the batter, as if she were relaying her feelings through it.
As much I hate to admit it, I only got this far because of Makoto... I polished my skills because I wanted her to acknowledge me.
My feelings reached her and she finally acknowledged me... But, achieving that goal just made me greedy...
Greedy?
Yes. I know what I said before, but I've come this far and I still want to win.
If I'm going to get better, then I need Makoto to nourish me further... I guess you could say Makoto was{W:700} my{W:0} Ultimate Sweet.
She's... the Ultimate Sweet for you?
Wha... I-I don't get it?
At first, I thought Makoto acknowledging me meant she was my Ultimate Sweet, but I was wrong.
It's a whole new extreme to label something as "ultimate." It's absurd to think her acknowledging me meant something like that.
If I became complacent, and were satisfied with just that, then I'd stop growing...
I want to become closer to what I'd consider "ultimate," and to go above and beyond... There wouldn't be any point if my goal wasn't distant and far away.
For me, the Ultimate Sweet is something I can never really achieve, but something I strive to be even a little bit closer to...
Ah, but I'll keep trying, no matter what!
The Ultimate Sweet is what drives you to mature, and it being unachievable is what motivates you to keep reaching out for it...
No matter what anyone says, I won't budge from what I believe in! I'll head down my chosen path with all my heart. It might be a clumsy trek, but it's the only way I know how to live.
So...
Her hands stopped kneading the batter.
I want you to forgive me for what I'm about to do next... 
Huh?
Forgive you for... what you're about to do next...? What are you talking about?
And as I faltered, Hana drew her face closer to me. 
Huh? What? Huuuuh...?!
Muah!
She drew close and covered my lips with her own.
Nn... Muah... Nnnng... Mmmph... 
Hana's tongue pressed against our locked lips, slid into my mouth, and entangled with my own tongue.
Mmm... Muah... Mmmm...!
Saliva flowed out as our tongues intertwined.
Muah... Nngh...
Hana gulped it down, almost like she were drowning, and hot air escaped her nostrils and transferred to me.
Nnng... Muuuuuha... 
And with a somehow drunken expression, Hana finally released me. 
I'm sorry... I've done... something quite shameful... 
Hana apologized between her hot sighs, her face bright red.
...To be honest, I'd intended to wait until you were certain of your feelings. But, there wasn't much time left...
Huh?
I mean... The exam will end soon, and I'll have to go home to Kyoto...
Ah... 
Right...
Our reunion was a temporary one. When the exam ended, we'd have to part again.
I was so caught up with everything, I'd completely forgotten.
So... I'll be going in and prepared for an all-out war.
I love you, Yanushi-kun. 
...!
Thump, thump!
Thump, thump, thump, thump...!
I could feel my heart beat like crazy again.
It was the same nervous pulse from earlier.
The same one I felt when making cakes with Hana. 
But it was somehow different from the excitement I usually felt when making cakes... And that's...
I already knew how I felt.
Maybe I knew it years ago, when we first met...
I understand. You don't have to wait anymore, though...
This time, I extended my hands and pulled Hana into a tight embrace.
...?! 
I love how strong you are, and how you give everything one-hundred and ten percent.
I love how earnest you are...
I love how tomboyish you can be, and how you're never honest with yourself.
I love... you. 
...?!
Yanu... kun...?!
I hugged Hana tightly. 
Ah... Aaaah. Aaaaaaah...! 
Hana began weeping something that couldn't be considered words.
We... now...? 
She managed to squeeze a few words out between her wails. 
We... cou... now... right...? 
Huh?
We... are... a couple... now, right?
O-Oh, yeah. We're officially a couple now... 
It felt a little awkward saying that now.
Heheh... Heheheh... This feeling... I can only feel this with the one I love... Heheh... Heheheh...
Hana smiled with tears streaming down her face.
And that was the single most attractive smile I'd ever seen her make...
