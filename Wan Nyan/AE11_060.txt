Hello and welcome to Beans Puppy!
Three customers, yes? You can sit over there, by the window.
(There's more customers today than yesterday. I guess our reputation is improving, bit by bit?)
(At this rate, maybe seeing the shop booked every day by the time the exam ends isn't just a dream.)
(No, we can't just let it be a dream! We'll make it happen.)
(I gotta show Onii-chan how much I've grown!)
Thank you for your patience. Here's your cake of the day!
Female Customer A
It's here! I've been wanting to try this.
Female Customer C
Look at how stylish this cake is!
Female Customer B
Hehe. It's not just how it looks, so wait until you taste it! You'll be shocked by how good it is!
Female Customer A
Isn't this different from what we ordered last time?
Female Customer B
It's the "cake of the day," so it's different each time.
Female Customer A
Oh, I get it. 
Female Customer C
What's this cake, mister? 
It's a banana tiramisu. 
Female Customer A
You can put bananas in tiramisu?
Yes. Our creation combines coffee cream, bananas, and mascarpone for a thicker tiramisu.
Female Customer B
I don't quite get it, but I'll have a better idea once I take a bite. Let's dig in!
Female Customer C
Right, let's try it.
Please, I hope you enjoy it.
Female Customer A
Just lemme snap a picture of it first... Oh, can I take a photograph of it?
Go ahead.
Female Customer A
Okay, so cheese... All right, let's dig in. Om.
Female Customer A
Mmm! It's so good! The cake we had last time was great, but this one is so tasty!
Female Customer B
It is! 
Female Customer C
Damn! I think this might be{W:700} too{W:0} good!
Female Customer B
I told you, didn't I? This place is great. 
Female Customer C
I mean, since it's you two, I only listen to you guys 30% of the time.
Oh, you're returning customers. Thank you for your patronage. 
Female Customer A
I mean, it was just too good!
Female Customer B
And besides, today we came here for you.
For... me?
Female Customer A
That's right! We thought we saw a cute guy last time, so we came to check you out.
Female Customer B
Hey, what's your name?
(They're trying to flirt with him!)
(Aaah! What are you smirking about?! You're a perv, Onii-chan!)
(What's going on here?! I'm surrounded by rivals and now the customers are hitting on him?!)
(At this rate, I'll be up to my neck in competition...! I have to make Onii-chan notice me and fast!)
