I eventually found myself making a cake, as focusing on a single task should help me center myself.
Not only that, but I'd just bother the customers as I walked around the store with a mopey expression on my face.
And it wasn't like I could stay idle in the kitchen, either. However, I wouldn't have time to worry if I focused on making a cake.
With that in mind, I returned to the kitchen.
...Inukai, we're running out of ingredients. I'll go pick some up from the storeroom. 
Oh, all right. Please do! We've had a lot of customers today, so we were bound to run low eventually...
Ah... 
Michiyo-san left the kitchen, as if she'd switched places with me.
Gah...
Michiyo-san... 
(Michiyo-san's getting ingredients from the storeroom... by herself! This is my chance!)
Rather than going deeper into the kitchen, I turned around and followed Michiyo-san's footsteps.
Ah, Onii-chan, where are you off to...?
I'll go help Michiyo-san! The bags of flour are heavy, so she'll probably need help carrying it.
Oh, okay. Be careful. Should I come and help, too?
Nono asked with a wave, but I left before she could follow after us.
...Will Onii-chan be okay? Michiyo-san looks really upset... Mmm...
