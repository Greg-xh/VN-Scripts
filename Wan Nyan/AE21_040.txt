Sorry for making you wait. 
That's fine. I'm sorry for intruding... You're even serving me tea!
It's not a big deal. Did Mom say anything to you?
Not really. She just asked me how things were going between us.
What was she thinking?!
S-So, what did you say? 
We get along great and we're good friends.
She definitely took it the wrong way... That explains why she looked so smug back there...
How so?
It's nothing for you to worry about.
Anyway, it's been a while since I've been to your place, huh?
You haven't been here since we were in school, so it's been a while.
Isn't it strange? We've known each other for so long, but it feels like we just met yesterday.
Yeah, time goes by fast. Ten years pass by in the blink of an eye.
Ten years... It's hard to imagine it's been that long... I wonder what we'll be like in another ten years?
You'll probably be a world-famous p｡tissier by then.
It won't be easy. In ten years, I'll probably still be training every day and night. 
I'm sure you'll be fine. You're a hard worker, Kenta-kun. I guarantee that. 
Just kidding. My guarantee doesn't really mean much, does it?
That's not true. It means a lot to hear you say that.
I can't even imagine what my future will be like ten years from now, but I hope we're still friends then.
You shouldn't worry about that, I feel the same way. 
Thank you. 
I should be saying that to you! Thank you for always being so kind to someone like me.
You're not just "someone," Kenta-kun.
I feel like I can do anything when you're with me. You're like the source of my power, Senpai.
A girl like me doesn't have that kind of power. 
You're not just some "girl" either, Senpai.
Ahaha... Let's head back, okay?
Sure.
