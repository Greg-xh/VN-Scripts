...Well, I just woke up early for no reason. 
My body and mind felt refreshed, although that made it difficult to go back to sleep.
It was still too early for breakfast, and would likely feel famished by lunchtime if I ate now.
I was probably the only one awake, too... Maybe I should go watch TV in the dining hall, or something.
Morning, Kenta-kun. 
Hey, good morning. You're up early. 
Why are you up at this hour?
Just woke up and couldn't fall back asleep.
That happens sometimes. 
Did you happen to wake up early today, too, Senpai?
Nope. I always wake up around this time.
You're an early riser, huh?
Sleeping too much just makes me more tired.
I gotcha. That really does fit my image of you, though.
Huh? You see me as an early bird?
Something about it feels healthy and wholesome.
You see me as a wholesome person?
Well, you've always been so energetic and cheerful. I don't remember you ever being sick, either.
...Come to think of it, I haven't been sick since the third grade.
See? You're a really healthy person.
...Is that a good thing?
Of course it is. Being in good health is important. I love seeing your cheerful smile. 
Uh, haha... Thank you.
What's your secret to staying healthy?
I wake up early, eat three square meals a day, always wash my hands going to the bathroom, and... I go on walks, too, I guess?
You do?
Yup. I take a walk every single morning.
Are you heading out to do that now? Mind if I tag along?
Of course I don't mind.
Thank you!
No need to thank me.
I don't want to cut into your alone time, is all.
No, no. I enjoy having someone to talk to.
So, are you ready to go?
Sure.
