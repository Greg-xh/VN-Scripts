Thank you for stopping by!
Phew, I'm pooped. 
I flopped onto my bed with a sigh.
I could stand in a kitchen and bake cakes all day, any day, but serving customers was exhausting.
Dealing with customers was just another part of this exercise.

Wait, no. As future chefs, our professors stressed the importance of eating properly and maintaining personal hygiene.
I can't remember which teacher said that, though...
I've traveled all over Japan, so my memory was a little hazy.

Mmm... I hardly ate anything for dinner, and my brain clearly needs food...
Fine. I'll whip up some dinner in the dining hall.
