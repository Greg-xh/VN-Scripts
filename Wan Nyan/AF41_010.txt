...Hm?
Mmm...?
I awoke with a start.
After a quick glance at the clock, I realized it was only six in the morning.
I pulled the blanket over my head and tried to go back to sleep.

Rustle. 
Ugh... The birds outside are too loud and I can't fall back asleep...
Well, it only made sense.
I'd often wake up early while I was traveling to prepare ingredients and the like.
It would've made sense for me to get up this early if I were commuting from home, but the store was less than a minute away from the dorms.
It looked like my body wasn't quite used to such convenient conditions.
Well then, maybe I'll take a walk around the academy!
