Phew! Your cakes really are incredible, and our compatibility is off the charts!
Your cakes always give me a ton of energy! Not only are they tasty, but I get a huge power boost out of it!
Let's get some breakfast and prepare for a hard day's work!
Y-Yeah... You're such a cheerful person, Hina... A good night's sleep works wonders. Haha...
Yup, everyone knows that! It's common knowledge.
You sleep, eat, work, eat, and sleep... That's how life goes.
You become disoriented and weak without either food or sleep. Both are essential for a working adult.
You should never go without food or sleep, otherwise it'll affect your work! You won't be able to move very well, either...
Yeah, you're absolutely right. People shouldn't ignore basic necessities.
I let out a heavy sigh as "Professor" Hina, who was perpetually energetic and likely to live forever, gave me a health lecture.
It somehow felt like I'd used up all of my energy today, but I couldn't afford to be tired now.
We had to get ready for when the doors opened. There was an entire workday ahead, so I had to follow Hina's example and pull myself together.
Let's go, then! I'll work really hard today, and eat lots of yummy food and cakes! Yay!
Yeah! I'll work hard too, um... Phew, aaah... 
My lower half was pretty spent at this point, though...
Hehe. Let's do our best today and sell lots of tasty sweets!
Right back at you. Let's work hard and hope we get lots of customers today, Hina.
Whenever we were together, I always seemed to be following Hina's lead.
Going at such a bright, cheerful pace was welcomed... I think. I was, however, grateful to not have any downtime to worry about the little things.
