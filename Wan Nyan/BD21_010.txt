How's it going? 
I'm doing my best to pile them together right now. 
Pile what togeｩAaaah! What's that?!
Those are pancakes. 
I can see that! How many are there?! One, two, three, four... thirteen...
I'm just getting started. It won't be enough until I've got at least twenty of them ready. 
No, that's plenty! One person can't eat that many!
But I can. 
Well, yeah, but that's you! People don't usually eat that much and have, I dunno, three to five at most?
Talk about lightweights.
You're not the right person to compare to... 
You see, that's always bothered me whenever I'm at work.
I'm sure there are plenty of customers who'd love to eat more.
Oh, yeah. We've been getting a lot of male customers lately, too.
Making twenty pancakes is kind of overdoing it, though.
But they are so yummy... Schlp...
Hey, wait until we can offer them samples.
