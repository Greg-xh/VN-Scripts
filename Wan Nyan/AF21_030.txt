Mmm~! Mmm~! Mmmhmm~!
W-Wait up, Hana... 
Hana pranced around before me as I noisily trailed after her with her shopping bags in tow.
Why do I have to be your whiny gopher?! What is this, some manga from the 80s?!
Ohohohoh...! I'm wearing a brand-new outfit, and walking around with all those bags on my arms simply wouldn't do!
With that, she fluttered away like a butterfly once again.
Heheh... What do you think? 
Wh-What do I think...? I think the bags are heavy. 
Huh? But I... picked these based on your opinion...?
Well, you asked me what I liked...
Right. I wanted to know your taste in clothing, Yanushi-kun. So...
I figured... If I had to wear something, I'd wear something you'd like!
Huh? What did you say?
I replied, having missed what she had just said.
...!
Eee...!?
I cried out in surprise.
D-Did I say something to offend you...? 
...
Hana glared at me... 
I-It's fine! If you... satisfy me on today's d-date, then I'll forgive you!
...Huh?
L-Like I said, you'll want to keep me happy on our... d-date today! Understood?!
Will you forgive me if I do...?
Y-Yes... Of course I will.
