Mmm...
Mm... Ah, aah... Aaah...?
Morning came and I awoke to the unusual presence of another person in my room.
...Good morning, Yanushi. 
Ah... Good morning, Nee-san... 
Nee-san sat beside me with flushed cheeks. She looked away awkwardly as she got dressed.
Nee-san had come to my room last night and asked me to keep her company while she sobered up, and then...
...I didn't think I was{W:700} that{W:0} inebriated, but apparently I was... I-I do remember everything, of course...
So, as a result, I... well, what on earth did I get us into...?!
Ah, um... Well, I-I consented to this, so I don't really think it's that big of a deal.
I'm sorry... P-Please forgive me, Yanushi... It's all my fault. I got drunk and let myself get carried away, and roped... you into this...
I'm so sorry. Please forgive me! I can't believe I did this... to an old friend, to a student... I...!
Ah. Uh, um... Well, like I said, you... didn't force me into it. I{W:700} really{W:0} got into it, too.
I was really into it as soon as things got going, so... You don't have to apologize!
It almost sounded like{W:700} I{W:0} was the girl getting accosted here, and Nee-san was the guy who got drunk and forced himself on me.
In all seriousness, we'd consented to it and enjoyed it. There was nothing to apologize for.
...Right. We gave verbal consent, and you enjoyed it... So, what you're saying is, what we did was between two consenting adults...
That's right. You remember what happened last night, right? Not once did I push you away or tell you I didn't want to.
...Th-That's right. You were really into it, and were quite assertive when you...
Ah... S-Sorry, Nee-san... You, uhh, were the one who offered, so I was sure you were okay with this too, but...
It was now my turn to apologize. I became keenly aware of the dangers of getting drunk and how to avoid complicated situations like these.
Ah, you don't need to apologize... I'm glad you liked it. If you didn't, we can, um, leave it at that... 
L-Let's make this our little secret... and we can think of it as a dream and forget about it, u-understood?!
No, I can't do that... Ah, wait, Nee-san!
Aaah...
She flushed bright red mid-conversation and she ran off on me...
...Nee-san... 
With Nee-san gone, I found myself patting the sheets she'd sat on.
When I realize Nee-san was here just a moment ago, it all felt so precious. However, at the same time, my face grew hot and I awkwardly pulled my hand away.
Um...
I had sex with drunk my older sister and it's turned into a huge mess.
Should I be anxious or laugh the whole thing off? I couldn't tell and merely sat there in silent turmoil.
Well, I'm awake now...! I should get ready to work my butt off today!
For now, I should wash my face, eat breakfast, and try to calm down. I wouldn't get to work on time if I just sat around.
I'd get up, go to work, and come back here once my shift was over. I could think everything through then. Otherwise, I'd be late!
