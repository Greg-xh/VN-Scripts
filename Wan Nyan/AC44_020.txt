Those long summer days drew to a close, and a new season was upon us. For our group, and our relationship...
It happened just as the fresh summer breeze made way for the chilly winds of autumn. 
Thank you for waitin', everyone! It's time to announce the exam results!
As an FYI, I worked really hard as your chairwoman, too.
Believe it or not, I used my mother's connections to talk to all of the famous store owners around the world, just so I could keep my promise and let ya work wherever ya wanted!
At first it didn't seem like you were actually going to keep that promise... 
Ahaha, I think that's one thing you shouldn't be pointing out now. 
She's right, be quiet! I'll hold ya back a year, and then you'll have to work for free next year, too!
That sounds problematic. 
Indeed.
So, starting over... It's time to announce the results! 
I could hear everyone swallowing nervously as the chairwoman read the results aloud within that tense atmosphere...
The winners are...!
