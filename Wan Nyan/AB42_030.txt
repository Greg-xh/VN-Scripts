Koro-chan, that's salt. 
Huh? Aaah, no, I messed it up!
I've never seen someone actually mix up salt and sugar before. I thought it only happened in fiction.
Ahaha... Making an elementary mistake like this makes me feel so lame...
You're acting kind of strange, Koro-chan.
I agree. Did something happen?
No, I'm fine!
You always work so hard, but are you sure you're not forcing yourself?
I'm not, really!
I kind of doubt that, considering you're trying to put an unpeeled lychee on a strawberry shortcake.
Huh? Whoa, you're right!
That's a pretty impressive mistake. It's hard to believe nothing's wrong with you. 
And, even if nothing were wrong, it'll cause huge problems for the store if you keep screwing up.
Isn't that kind of harsh?
I'm just stating the facts. 
Makoto-chan's right. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to cause problems...
You don't have to apologize, just don't repeat these mistakes. 
Yeah, I'll be careful. I'm really sorry...
That's enough of that. Everyone messes up sometimes, and I'll cover for you if you make any other mistakes.
That's right, we're all friends here. You don't have to feel reserved around us.
Thanks. 
Now that we've got this settled, let's get back to work.
Sure!
