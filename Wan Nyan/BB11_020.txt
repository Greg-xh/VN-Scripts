It sure is quiet. 
Mhm. It's so quiet, I can hear you breathing.
The campus sure does have a certain... atmosphere to it at night. It feels like something could jump out at any second.
Do you believe in ghosts?
If I had to say, probably not. It would be cool if ghosts were real, though. 
So you think they are cool?
Are you not scared of ghosts? You don't seem fazed by the idea at all.
Oof... I hate this. Why am I always like this?!
I'd seem girlier if I got scared by this stuff, but it looks like we're just taking a walk...
I think it's fine. That's just who you are.
Are you implying I'm not girly enough?!
Not at all. That's not what I meant.
Is it, now? 
I find your lack of faith disturbing. You're wonderful, Senpai. You're plenty girly, even if you're not scared of ghosts. 
Flattery will get you nowhere.
It's not flattery. I really do think that. You're great, Senpai.
...Really?
Definitely. I swear it on my life. 
This isn't worth swearing your life for. 
That's just how wonderful I think you are. 
F-Fine, I get it... I'll believe you. Thanks... 
So long as you understand. 
J-Jeez... Here, we made it.
Oh, already? 
Doesn't take long to get here. Let's go in.
Hmm? There's a jar on the desk. 
We need to take a cookie from the jar, then head for the dining hall using a different route. It's so we don't bump into the others.
Gotcha. Let's take a cookie, then. 
We need to hurry, or Makoto's group might catch up to us.
Sure.
