Mmm~! Mmm~! Mmmhmm~!
Hana's gait seemed much lighter compared to before.
Haa... Haa... Haa... All that matters... is making... Hana happy...
The bags, however, had only gotten heavier.
Ahaha! I had a lot of fun today, Yanushi-kun.
Haa... I'm tired, though... 
Whoa! Look at that lovely swimsuit, Yanushi-kun! 
Hana stopped in front of an outdoor apparel store.
W-Wait... Isn't it showing a little too much skin?
Right... I might be able to wear it if it was just the two of us on a private beach... Hint, hint...
What do you mean, "Hint, hint"?
Heheheh... I wonder...? 
Sure, I'll buy it for you... Please let me get it for you... 
...
...
...
Whoa! Look at all that lovely lingerie, Yanushi-kun! 
This time, we stopped at a lingerie store and Hana held out a matching undergarment set before my eyes.
S-Stop. You can't go waving that around in front of me like that.
Heheh... What are you saying? Next time, you may see me wearing these...
Huuuh?! W-Wait up, you can't say that here, either!
If you want to leave that badly, then why not take advantage of the situation and get this for me while I'm still interested...?
Sure, I'll buy it for you... Please let me get it for you...

Yanushi-kun! Over here! I'm over here! 
Hana waved to me enthusiastically after finding a nearby karaoke place.
Huh? I've never done this kind of thing before...
Karaoke and dates go hand in hand! When you think of karaoke, you think of duets and back side tracks!
Uh, I don't really keep up with current music trends...
I'm sure we could find something for us to sing together, though...
No, it's more like I don't really listen to music...
Ahaha. You too?
...Wait. Weren't you talking about doing a duet and singing along to backing tracks earlier?!
Heheh... It's odd, isn't it? That I don't really listen to music much... Heheheh...
Phew... 
Hana's laughter suddenly trailed off as she sat down on a bench.
I'm a bit parched... Yanushi-kun, would you be so kind as to buy me a cola?
Sure thing.
I left the bags with Hana and walked over to the nearby vending machine.
Moments later, I walked back over to Hana with two colas in hand.
...
Illuminated by the streetlight overhead, I found Hana intently flipping through the book in her hands.
Hm...? She's not reading a cookbook this late, is she...?
With that, I approached her.
Whatcha reading? 
Huh? Huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh?!
I-I-I-I-I-It's nothing! 
Hm? Here.
I handed Hana her drink and got a quick peek at the book she was hiding behind her back.
"First Dates for the Clueless Maiden! Tsundere Edition."
Hmm... It's, well, the kind of title I didn't expect to ever see outside of a book or a movie...
I-Is something the matter?
Ah...
As I shook my head, a thought suddenly crossed my mind. 
She's been running me ragged all day... Perhaps this was her trying to figure this "first date" thing out.
U-Um... I... "I had a lot of fun today..."
Whoa. That sounded like she had read that line straight out of a book!
H-Hmm... "There's no one at my place tonight..."
Hm? U-Uh, I guess there isn't...?
So, uh... "We missed the last train..."
No... There's still plenty of time until the last train, and we can walk back by foot from here. 
And just as I thought that... 
Rendezvous Man
...Hey? ...Right?
Rendezvous Woman
Huh? But... aren't we...?
Hm...?
Rendezvous Woman
Come on... please? 
Rendezvous Man
But...
H-Hmm...! I don't want...
Rendezvous Woman
I don't... want to go back tonight... 
Thud! 
Could you not steal my lines?!
I tried to calm down the now fuming Hana.
Aaaah! Hana, what are you doing?! 
We looked behind us and found a couple eyeing Hana with utter amazement.
Ah...
Hana's face turned red like a tomato, and then...
Ahaha... Pardon me! 
Whoosh! 
...She ran off in a flustered sprint.
Hey, wait up, Hana! 
Ah, sorry about that. Enjoy yourselves... 
Rendezvous Man
Like we could! 
The man's annoyed shout sent me trailing after Hana once again...
