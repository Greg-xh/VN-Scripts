Kenta & Hana
Uh, um...!
Wh-What is it? 
N-No, you go first. 
I was surprised. 
Hana actually gave someone else permission to speak. Made me wonder if jelly beans would rain from the sky tomorrow.
Nothing, really... It wasn't anything serious. I just wanted to apologize if I got in the way of you making that cake.
It was after the confession. 
But Hana was still working on her cake.
Just like the clock on our relationship was ticking, as was her opportunity to face Makoto.
There wasn't much I could do about it, other than watch over them from the sidelines. But, maybe, that just made Hana more conscious about me.
She didn't make much progress and decided to stop for today, but... 
You're not getting in the way... Even if the whole world were here to back me up, you're worth more to me than that.
R-Really...? That's impressive... Ahaha...
Ohohohohoh...
Talk about an awkward conversation, if I do say so myself... I guess you could call it innocent, too...
W-Well, in that case, I'll see you tomorrow. 
I grabbed the doorknob for my room, when...
Squeeze... 
Hm?
The palm of Hana's hand lay over mine. 
Then... Is this goodbye?
Wh-What? But there's tomorrow... 
Not tomorrow... Today... Let's stay together, until tomorrow comes... 
Hana looked up and implored me with her sad eyes.
