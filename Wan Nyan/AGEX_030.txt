By the way, Yanushi... Should I, uhh... Should I, how do I say this, well, erm... 
Mmm? 
After that, we spoke leisurely and rested vacantly in the store.
Michiyo-san nestled up and fidgeted in my arms for a long while. After some time had passed, she started muttering and directing a series of questions at me.
Um... Should I act a bit more feminine? Like Nekojou, I mean, more like a girl would...
How I speak and carry myself, for example. Would a cuter, softer demeanor make me more feminine in your eyes...?
...Didn't I tell you already? You're fine the way you are. 
Forcing yourself to change how you talk or act would be hard on you too, right? I wouldn't be happy watching you try and be something you're not...
I see... In that case, I should stay the way I am... But are you really all right with that? 
Huh? 
I act like a man... So maybe if it's not someone cuter, like Nekojou or another girl, it just isn't... How do I put it... 
Yeah, you have nothing to worry about, because I like you. And if I say I like you the way you are, then there's no reason for you to change, is there?
...Nng... 
Michiyo-san couldn't find anything else to say.
Drawing closer to her face, I found myself smiling.
I wanted to stay this way a little longer. If we did, we'd talk while sitting shoulder to shoulder with my arms wrapped around her.
