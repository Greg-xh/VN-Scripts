Phew, what a great bath.
I somehow got through my first day. It was a different kind of pressure when you're doing the real thing.
I can't say I wasn't anxious, but what I{W:700} can{W:0} say is this:
With everyone on my side, I know we'll do a great job together!
Training while traveling wasn't the only way I improved my skills. Being surrounded by talented people was a great way to do it, too!
Working with such skilled p｡tissi｢res, who were also chosen as candidates, was incredibly stimulating.
I felt as though they could give me what training on my own couldn't.
And that would bring me one step closer to making the{W:700} Ultimate Sweet!{W:0}
All right! If I sleep now, tomorrow will come sooner!
