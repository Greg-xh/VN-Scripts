W-We're finally back...
Are you okay? You're as white as a sheet.
Nono wasn't much better, though.
...
Heehee, Micchan's so cute when she's scared. It makes me so excited when I think about her clinging to me and shaking like crazy.
Haa... Haa... W-Water, please... 
I can't bring myself to make fun of you for looking so miserable.
It was a quick round trip, but you're petrified. Such adorable little things.
They can't hold a candle to you, Hana. You were scared stiff the whole way.
C-Can you please refrain from spreading slander?!
Really? You tried to hide how terrified you were by talking up a storm.
I was simply being considerate and assumed{W:700} you{W:0} were scared!
Is that right? I guess your high-pitched voice was just playing tricks on me, then.
Y-Your fear must've made you imagine things!
I-I thought I was going to die... Ah... Uwah...
I was thinking we could do some party games after this, but I don't think you're up for it...
It's a bit of a shame, but let's call it good here for the day. I'll try to think of something everyone can enjoy next time. 
Please do... 
This concludes our test of courage, then. Thanks, everyone. Let's go to bed.
