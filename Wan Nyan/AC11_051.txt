Makoto's dad was quite upset at first, claiming she couldn't do things like that when she's "still a half-pint." He ultimately gave in and went along with the apprenticeship.
They sent me on errands at the start of my training, but her old man eventually warmed up to me toward the end.
He realized you were worthy... Worthy of succeeding Nekonoya.
That's right, succeeding the... huh?! M-Makoto...?!
Hello there. 
Hey... Wh-When did you come in? 
While you were in flashback mode. I was looking for a chance to spend some alone time with you.
Alone time...? What for? 
Haah... I knew you were dense, but jeez...
Let's see, where do I start? There was plenty of foreshadowing, like how I wanted to follow in your footsteps and started studying Western confectionery...
Right. 
I assumed you'd take part in this exam. You wouldn't let such a huge chance pass you by.
So, as a result, I became Kyoto's candidate. All so I could participate and track you down.
Really?
I mean, you don't even have a cell phone! You kept going from place to place, all for the sake of training, and I couldn't mail you a single letter.
Did something happen that warranted sending a letter?
Haah... Here's your first hint: I made you, a total stranger, my apprentice. It meant I felt something from the moment I met you.
We have an affinity for making sweets, and you picked up on that... right?
That's part of it... Hint number two: Remember how Dad had you study Japanese sweets with me, specifically the shop's secret recipe?
Your dad is a scary guy. He owns a well-established store, so I thought training under him would be hell and he'd say stuff like, "You're not here to study, but to steal my techniques!"
More or less. That describes Dad and the other artisans pretty well. They knew how I felt about you, though...
The other artisans, huh? They were really kind, and would often call me "Lad." It eventually turned into "Prince," though... Wait, Prince?
And they called me "Princess."
Oh yeah. Wait, prince and princess... Huh? What?
You're starting to piece it together. Here's your last hint, then...
I love you, Kenta. 
...?! H-Huh...?! Th-Thank you. Talk about an easy-to-understand clue. But, why?
Because I love you... That's not all, though. I love Japanese sweets and Nekonoya, too. It's how I was raised.
I love Dad, my family, all the artisans, and Kyoto itself... That's why I want the whole world to know how wonderful Japanese sweets are.
And I need you to do it, Kenta. I need your passion and talents for making sweets!
I just want to make cakes, though...
So, sweets. 
Yeah, sweets.
You make the cakes, and I'll make the Japanese confections.
Yes, that's right. 
But... You still wish to make tasty sweets, right?
Definitely! 
That's why we'd make perfect partners. As such, we'd push one another to new heights... Together, we can become confectionery artisans who take the world by storm!
You want me to be your partner? 
Yes, only you. Besides, Dad and the other artisans have high expectations for us.
They want us to make the world's best confections?
Not quite... They want us to make{W:700} something,{W:0} though...
Like what?
A baby... Teehee. 
Wh-Wha?! A baby... Th-This is going way too fast!
Not really. This was normal back in the Heian period.
That's a thousand years too early... A baby, now?
We can get married first.
Nope!
Well... Fine, then. I'll settle on being lovers for now.
Lovers...
Do you like someone else?
Someone else...? Um...
Teehee, I don't need to know. Even if you did, I don't care. I'm not going to lose to them.
After all, I'm... your one and only. Both in making sweets and in romance... Mwah!
Aaah, Makoto... Mmmm, nn...!
