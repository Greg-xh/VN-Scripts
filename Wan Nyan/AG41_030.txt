...
After closing and cleaning up the shop, I'd changed out of my uniform and stood around absentmindedly.
Just blankly staring out into space...
...What's wrong? Aren't you going back?
Ah...
A voice brought me back to reality, and sent me into a flustered, surprised daze instead.
The one who spoke up to me was none other than...
What's the matter? Were you that surprised? Pardon, I didn't mean to startle you.
Ah, n-no, it's nothing... I was just zoning out a bit, ahaha...
Even I thought I was acting strange, but I had to talk my way out of it.
Mm?
Um...
I wasn't conscious of it until now, but I'd reply without thinking whenever she called out to me.
Everything changed once I realized I liked her.
I felt embarrassed whenever I looked at her, and looking away only made things awkward when she stared at me in return.
...Yanushi?
...
Before I knew it, I found myself gazing at Michiyo-san. Not only that, but she was all I ever thought about.
My mind would always wander back to her, even when she wasn't around. Talking to her made me happy, and it was fun being together...
(What's going on...? Has my world really changed that drastically in just a short amount of time...?!)
I was like a girl in love. Michiyo-san was so dignified and wise, yet somehow{W:700} I{W:0} ended up acting like the girl in this scenario...
Are you all right? You look tense... Are you tired?
Ah, n-no, it's fine. I'm just zoning out... But maybe I am a bit tired, ahaha... 
I don't{W:700} feel{W:0} tired, it's just that pleasant feeling you get after working hard... There's a lot we have to pay attention to, not to mention taking care of the customers, so...
I see. In that case, why don't we get some fresh air? A change of pace may do you some good.
Y-Yeah... Sure. We're done with work, so let's take a walk...
Michiyo-san invited me for an evening walk.
I was surprised, but it did make me happy. I had no reason to refuse, of course, so I nervously agreed.
