Phew, I'm pooped... Finally done with work for the day... Haah...
I was met with the pleasant tiredness that came after a long workday. It was really busy during the dinner rush, but it was oddly satisfying once it was all said and done. 
With work now over, I relaxed in my room and fell deep in thought.
(Hina and I seemed to be physically compatible, she was a great cook, and she really liked my cakes...)
We had a lot of fun together, and it felt like we were a good influence on each other.
One of the more important aspects was how her bright personality had healed and saved me time and time again.
(Have my words saved her, too? I don't know... If they hadn't, my cakes definitely did, right?)
She had a bit (or a lot) of a distinctive personality, but that was part of her charm. She's the kind of girl who was always fun to be around...
Hina, huh...?
I whispered her name and lightly sighed. For whatever reason, I felt like saying her name repeatedly.
Doing so made me thirsty, and prompted me to head to the dining hall for something to drink.
There should be a carton of juice or milk, or some mineral water; anything would do.
