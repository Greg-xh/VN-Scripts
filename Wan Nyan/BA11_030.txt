I can't wait for the get-together.
Yeah, I wonder what she's got planned for us. 
Maybe card games? I might not look it, but I'm a whiz at Old Maid!
I could see that. Card games are common at these sorts of things.
Maybe even a firework display? That sounds like fun!
We've got plenty of space and are far enough away from people's houses. I bet we could set quite a few off.
I've liked the parachute type fireworks since I was a little girl. I'd always run after them so I could pick up the parachutes!
Oh, yeah, I know what you mean! I did the same thing when I was a kid, too.
I still do it sometimes, actually...
Really? I couldn't imagine you doing that, but you learn something new every day.
If we{W:700} were{W:0} going to do fireworks, I'd really like to us to wear yukata... Girls always look so pretty in them... I just want to lick them all over...
...Just this once, I think we should skip the yukata.
By the way, I'd heard girls often don't wear underwear when wearing a yukata because they tend to stick out. Is that true?
I'm not sure if it was like that in the past, and I haven't heard about anyone{W:700} not{W:0} wearing underwear.
Girls do all sorts of tricks to make sure their panties don't stick out.
Figures. What's your secret, Hina?
Me? Of course I wouldn't wear them.
...Of course? Anyway, we probably won't be playing card games or shooting off fireworks.
What makes you say that?
I ran into Senpai this morning. She had apparently done{W:700} something{W:0} in one of the classrooms on campus.
That's gotta be related to the get-together tonight, right?
What else could we possibly do while on campus, though?
Not a clue. It was just a guess.
Aaah, I can't wait for tonight...
Same here, but we should really be getting back to work!
Yup!
