Ugh, I failed again. I thought the cake would go over better than the massage, but she scared me off.
Hmm... I don't know what else to do now that your cake was a no-go. I can't believe she called you "unpleasant."
She admitted to liking the cake, but she still hates me...
I see... Well, in that case... 
In that case? 
Let's just call it quits. If your food didn't sway her, then nothing else we do will.
What?! That was only our second attempt and you're out of ideas?! You can't back out now! We've only just started!
Taken aback, I whined and quickly sidled up to Hina. She simply grinned at me in return.
That's right, just give up on Micchan. Starting today, you need to avoid her at all costs.
I'll make up for Micchan by being a better friend to you, so it's all good! You should only talk to her whenever it's something work-related.
Ah, um, thanks... I'm glad we're still friends, but... Um, giving up on her...
I didn't mind Hina holding my hand, but giving up on Michiyo-san to enjoy Hina's company twice over... I didn't know how to react to that.
You did what you could. The rest is Micchan's problem, and it's in her hands now.
It's not your fault, Ken-chan. You can figure out why she hates you so much later.
R-Right... I did what I could to fix this relationship, so the rest is up to her. Hmm, I guess you're right, I can't let this eat at me forever... 
Hina was a surprisingly positive and pragmatic person. Maybe her mature, worldly wisdom was the secret for longevity (?) and worth learning.
