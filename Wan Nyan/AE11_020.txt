Nn... Mmmmm... 
Phew... It's morning already... 
The weather looked quite nice today, which meant we'd likely see a lot of customers.
...Huh?
Something felt off...
My bed felt heavier than usual...
???
Heheheh... 
Whoa, it's twitching! There's something there!
Wh-Who's there?!
Meow.
What are you doing here, Makoto?! 
Exactly what it looks like. 
What does this look like... Did you sleepwalk here and sneak into my bed?
I'm not tired enough to pick the wrong room.
...You did this on purpose?
I most certainly did. 
Why are you doing this?
You're actually expecting an answer?
I'll be really confused otherwise.
Heh, I wanted to see you squirm some more, but fine, I'll tell you.
I did this because I felt like it. 
That's not an answer.
Isn't it? I don't think I can make myself much clearer than that.
I wanted to watch you sleep, hear you breathe, and to feel your warmth... That's all the reason I needed.
Watching me sleep isn't all that interesting.
Oh, but it is. I can't think of anything more fascinating.
Uhh, if you say so.
I do. Does this bother you?
Of course not.
We're all good, then.
You think so?
Definitely. We're both on the same page.
Are you going to do anything to{W:700} me{W:0}?
What am I supposed to do?
A pretty girl is lying in your bed. Don't you know men aren't supposed to reject a woman's advances?
Or did you think I'd do this if I wasn't ready for the consequences? 
Um... May I?
You may noooooooooooooooot!
Nono?! 
What do you think you're doing, Onii-chan?!
I'm, uhh, not sure how to answer that.
We were about to get busy. You're welcome to watch and take notes.
Not happening!
