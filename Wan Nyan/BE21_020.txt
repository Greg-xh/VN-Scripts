Ken-chan.
What, you're not going back?
I wanted to thank you for the yummy cake. They really are the best!
Such pure, unadulterated bliss! It felt like I was floating in a dream...
Eating your cakes really makes me happy. 
I'm sure I was born into this world just to eat your cakes.
You're exaggerating, but I'm glad you liked it so much.
No, no. My stomach fell in love after eating it! I'm positively nuts for it!
I'm so thankful for that, Ken-chan.
You don't have to thank me.
I insist! Please accept my gratitude.
Really, you don't have toｩNn?!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Something pressed against my lips and cut me off mid-sentence.
It was so sudden, I couldn't comprehend what had happened.
Something soft and warm pressed firmly against my mouth, followed by a slimey sensation gliding over my tongue.
It was then, in that moment, I realized she was kissing me.
Nnn... Nnnnnnn...!
Mmch... Schlp, mmpch...
H-Her tongue is wrapping around mine... It's like it had a mind of its own!
Mmm... Mmnh... Schlp, schlp...
Ugh... Nnn...
Haah... Mmsch, nngh...
Mmph... Schlp, mmch... Mmm... Schlp...
Hey!
What do you think you're doing?! Get away from him!
Haa, haa... I'm alive...
Boo! I wanted to taste Ken-chan's lips a little longer...
You can't! 
Hehe. I'm heading out, then. Good work today, everyone!
B-Bye. 
Jeez! Hina's a handful in more ways than one! H-Huh? Why are you looking at me like that?
Come over here, Onii-chan!
H-Huh? Wh-What?
