We need sugar, dish soap, and toilet paper... Am I forgetting anything?
Speaking of toilet paper, I think we need to change the light bulb in the men's bathroom.
Okay, a light bulb it is. 
Let's grab some flour while we're here, too. Won't have to worry about needing it later.
That's true. I'm glad you're here, otherwise I couldn't carry all of this by myself! I should take advantage of it.
Yup. Go ahead and work me to the bone.
Ahaha. So is this everything?
Oh, we almost forgot something important: Cat food.
You're so right! We'd be in big trouble if the kitties ran out of food.
They might try to steal the customer's food if we let them go hungry.
They'd never do that, right?
Of course they would. Unlike dogs, cats do whatever they want. Even more so since the chairwoman picked them up as strays and probably aren't house-trained...
Ah, the chairwoman... Mmm... Yeah, I could see that.
Right? 
At the very least, I'll make sure Tai grows up to be a good kitty!
Ahaha. Doesn't working together like this remind you of when we were at our old school?
You, too? I was just thinking the same thing.
We had to handle a lot of inventory for the student council back then. Not much has really changed.
Pretty much. I never thought we'd get to work together after you graduated, though.
You never told me you were going to enroll in PochiTama.
What was really surprising was when you called out to me during the entrance ceremony.
I remember that! Your face was the very definition of "stupefied"!
It startled me. That, and you studying to become a p｡tissi｢re instead of a baker.
Yup, I did. That takes me back...
We always ate your baked bread when the student council meetings ran late, and I always thought it was really good.
Putting aside that your family runs a bakery, you've got some amazing talent.
N-No way. It's embarrassing to hear you say stuff like that. Besides, I'm nowhere near as good as my dad.
I was sure you'd become a professional baker. 
Well, there's a lot of reasons behind that...
Like what?
Isn't bread kind of boring?
You think so?
It is! There's cute stuff you can do with sweet buns, but it can't compare to cakes.
You baked that delicious cake to thank me for the bread, and I remember how excited I was to eat it!
It was surprisingly yummy, and the kind of cute cake a girl would love.
When I ate it, I thought... 'P｡tissier are so amazing and cool!'
...Is that why you decided to become a p｡tissi｢re?
Ah, did I creep you out?! I think being cool is a big deal!
If I make this my career, I think being motivated by{W:700} something{W:0} is important!
Can't deny that. Looks like both of us want to turn this into a career.
You started taking this seriously after enrolling in PochiTama, right?
Mhm. I knew how to bake cookies before, though.
In a little over a year, you honed your skills enough to be selected for the Candidate Exam. That's some monstrous talent right there, if you ask me.
It's rude to call a beautiful young woman a monster.
What I meant was, you never cease to amaze me, Senpai.
I'm the one who should be saying that.
What do you mean?
I can't believe you know and are so friendly with all the candidates, too... Never took you for the skirt chaser type.
That's not it. I just got to know them while traveling.
Were you actually training or using it as an excuse to pick up girls?
Don't pick on me, Senpai!
Ahaha, sorry. I enjoy our talks, but we really should head back before the store opens. Let's wrap this up.
Sounds good.
Next is...
Senpai, watch out! There's aｩ
Huh? Ahhhhhh!!
O-Ouch... 
Are you okay? You're not hurt, right?
I'm fine... You caught me just in time, so I'm notｩ
Something wrong?
No... You're really close...
What was that? I missed it.
I-It's nothing... Hm, huh? 
Are you okay?
No, my leg feels numb...
It's okay. Don't panic. 
R-Right. Sorry. 
There's nothing to apologize for. 
Heh, you're right.
But, you know, you're really pretty when I look at you up close like this...
Whaaat?! Wh-What are you saying?!
I just said it without thinking...
You can't just say whatever you want like that. Besides, I'm totally average! 
I don't think that's true. I like the way you look. 
Saying that so nonchalantly is what makes you so scary.
Pardon? 
The other girls are much prettier and cuter than me. Like Shinono-chan...
They{W:700} are{W:0} pretty, but that doesn't mean you're inferior to them.
Ugh, fine! I surrender already! I might melt if you keep spouting all that embarrassing stuff!
You're blushing, Senpai. 
It's your fault!
O-Ouch... 
Are you all right? You don't have to strain yourself.
I... I'm fine...!
Oh, it's Onii-chan and Nekohana-san.
Hey. You stocking up, too?
Yup!
What do you need?
Flour. 
Are you able to carry it on your own? The bags are for commercial use and weigh over fifty pounds each.
Ugh... I'll try.
We could use more manpower around here. There's an odd number of candidates, they could've accepted another guy.
There's nothing we can really do about that now.
You're right. I'll put it on the cart for you.
Really, Onii-chan?! 
I can't have my cute little Nono hurt herself. This is the least I could do.
Thankies!
Don't jump on me like that. I can feel your chest on my arm.
Onii-chan, you pervert! Lech! Nincompoop! 
Hey, you're the one who hugged me. 
Well, never mind... We don't have much time, so let's clear this up... Heave ho!
You make it look so easy... Boys are great. 
I appreciate it, Onii-chan. Just this once, I'll let you off the hook for touching my breasts earlier.
Yeah, yeah. Thanks.
As a side bonus, I'll also let you take me out on a date on our next day off!
You'll "let me," huh...? If we're both free, then sure. Let's hang out.
You're free, right? Nothing to do? If you've got no plans, then it's decided!
Jeez, that's rude. 
...Kenta-kun, the time...
Oh, right! Sure, I'll see you soon!
H-Hey! Wait up, Onii-chan!
