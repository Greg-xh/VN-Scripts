We've changed into our uniforms, but it's still early, huh?
I don't think anyone will be up for another hour.
Ahaha, yeah... What do you feel like doing?
Do you have any ideas?
Changing clothes again seems silly...
Hmm... We could start setting up for the day, but we might lose track of time.
We could watch TV?
That feels like a waste, too...
What should we do, then?
W-Well, since we're alone for once, I figured you could give me, and only me, some attention...
Wh-Whoa, what am I saying?! Aaah, I can't help it, but my face feels like it's on fire!
You really are cute, Senpai.
D-Don't tease me.
I'm not trying to tease you. You really are cute. 
You're still mean, Kenta-kun.
I don't think so, but I'm fine with being called that if that's what it takes to say you're cute.
You're so amazing, Kenta-kun... You can say embarrassing stuff like that without batting an eye.
Did I say something embarrassing? 
You probably don't realize it, but it's still really unfair for me...
I don't really get it, but I'm sorry if I made you feel bad.
No, this isn't bad at all... If anything, I'm happy, or well, kind of embarrassed, or shy... 
Either way, you're wonderful. I'm grateful I got to know you. 
If you keep showering me with compliments like that, I'll... I'll... 
You'll what? 
Uhh... Y-Y-You might look down on me for this, but... I want to feel you with my body again, Kenta-kun... 
Senpai...
