Oh, crap. There really{W:700} is{W:0} a line!
We aren't scheduled to open for another hour, but there's already seven people...
I wouldn't lie about something like that!
Look at the Kitty Parlor! 
There's a line over there, too... What's going on?
The reason doesn't matter. We will provide them with the best service. 
Precisely! If they think we're good enough to line up early for, then we need to prove them right!
Yeah! 
I'll make super yummy sweets just for them!
Ooooh yeah, I'm getting fired up!
