Ah, you're all here. That's great!
Was there something you wanted to tell us?
That's right. I wanted you all to hear it, too.
What's going on?
Looks like you're up to something. 
That makes it sound like it's a bad thing, but... I do have a plan in mind.
Let's hear this plan of yours, then. I sure hope it's something good.
Please don't hype this up too much... 
Anyway, our meeting like this must've been fate, so I tried to think of ways we could get to know each other better.
Since we all live under the same roof, and with the exam still in progress, I figured it would be a good idea for all of us to be on good terms.
I want to be friends with everyone, too!
This exam was designed to evaluate our individual skills, so we're not rivals. I think there's merit to it.
On the contrary, these circumstances are quite advantageous.
Right? I think we should have a get-together, then!
A get-together? Did you have anything specific in mind?
You'll find out later! Let's all meet up later after we close up shop, okay?
Huh? You're keeping it a secret?
I don't know what you have up your sleeve, but I, for one, am looking forward to it.
Let's give it everything we've got so we can enjoy ourselves to the fullest later.
Of course. 
Let's eat up, then! We're gonna need plenty of energy for that!
I agree! I already finished my breakfast, but I couldn't pass up a second serving.
Huh? You had a full loaf's worth of sandwiches and three bowls of udon. How do you have room for more?!
It's fine! My belly's only half-full!
You ate that much and it's only half-full...? I don't know what to say...
A get-together, huh...? That sounds like fun.
