Oh, Kenta-kun, Shinono-chan!
Good evening, Senpai. 
You're coming back pretty late.
Yeah, we stayed behind to work on some cakes together. 
Really? That sounds nice. I wish I could have been a part of it. 
I have something to tell you, Nekohana-san. 
Huh, what is it? 
I'm definitely not losing to you!
Huh? Huh? What?
Let's go, Onii-chan. 
Wait... Don't pull me! I'll see you later, Senpai!
Uh? O-Okay. See you.
