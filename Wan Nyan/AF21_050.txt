Is everyone else asleep?
It's gotten rather late... 
Let's go before they see us... Thanks for everything today, Hana. It was a lot of fun.
I bid her goodnight and made a beeline for my bedroom.
O-Ooooooooooooouch! 
You mustn't raise your voice this late at night, Yanushi-kun!
So you say, but you're the one yanking on my sleeve!
Well, that's...
What?
That's... 
Uh, my sleeve's gonna tear at this rate...
I mean... I bought that new lingerie and it would be a waste if...
Ah... 
I could tell what she was implying and it left me at a loss for words.
Right, Hana got that risque lingerie this afternoon...
She peered up at me.
Whose fault was it that I bought this in the first place?
M-Me...?
P-Please... Take responsibility for what you did!
