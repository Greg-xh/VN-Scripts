My, my, my! Your chairwoman's impressed! Sales have been off the charts because of ya!
I really didn't expect it to be this successful. Why did we ever stop this great tradition?
You should ask yourself that question, and reflect on your past decisions. 
A-ny-way, it's straight-up amazin'!
Your reputation has gradually increased thanks to social media and blog coverage, and your growth over the last few days is nothing short of astounding.
Right? We're suddenly the hot, new thing! Business is a boomin' and I can't stop smilin'!
Thanks to that, we've gotten requests for TV and magazine interviews.
T-TV?! 
Yup, yup! They cover all the new and really popular shops!
Does that mean we're going to be on TV?!
Sure does!
Wow, that's amazing! My heart's beating like crazy.
Hehe! It seems my time in the spotlight has finally come!
I don't know about that, but this is undoubtedly a priceless opportunity.
Yeah. With all that media coverage, we should expect to see an even higher influx of customers pouring in.
Yup, yup! The academy's reputation will only skyrocket from there!
Hehehehe! The next fiscal year is in the bag for sure!
It's thanks to all of you. We were right to choose you as candidates, and you're our academy's pride and joy.
Now go turn that enthusiasm into hard work!
This concludes our morning briefing. You may head to your posts.
Onii-chan.
What's wrong? Everyone's gone ahead.
Yesterday wasn't a dream, just so you know!

Fine, then... Don't forget how serious I am!

...Crap. It wasn't a dream after all.
