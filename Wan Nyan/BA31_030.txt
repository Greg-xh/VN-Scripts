I talked a big game to Senpai, but I didn't know where to start... Not having any clues was going to make this difficult.
Maybe I'll look around here first... I just hope it's not hiding or something.
Ah, Onii-chan. 
Oh, hey. Are you cleaning?
What about you? Still looking for the cat?
I guess.
We looked, but didn't find it in the store.
Thanks, that saves me some work.
Do you think you'll be able to find it?
I'll do what I can, but who knows. 
Well, I don't wanna get in the way of your work. I'll be off.
All right.
