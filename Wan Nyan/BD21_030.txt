I'm so full... I can't eat another bite...
Glad to hear it. I wouldn't know what to do if you still had room after eating all that...
Am I going crazy, or are you eating way more than you used to back when I trained at your place?
I guess so. Dad's been saying that covering my food expenses has been a huge burden.
I feel for you, Master! 
Maybe I'm going through some weird growth spurt. Do you think it'll improve eventually?
Well, your appetite's kind of a charm point.
You really think it's charming?
Seeing how happy you are while you eat makes me happy, too.
I'll work extra hard so I can eat even more, then!
Please don't. Master's going to work himself to death if you do that.
We're back... Huh? There's no one here. 
Did they leave already?
Well, it'd be weird if they stayed behind at this hour.
Oh, that's right, I haven't thanked you for the cakes yet.
You did say it, though.
Saying it isn't enough. I'd like to somehow pay you back for them.
Aww, no worries. It's just between us, after all.
Your cakes were so good, and I can't possibly take them for free. 
Being compensated for your work is an important part of being an artisan, you know?
What will you give me, then?
Well... the only thing I{W:700} can{W:0} offer right now is my body.
With that, let's have sex, Ken-chan!
Yeah, figures...
