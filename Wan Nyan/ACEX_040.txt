Phew! I somehow made it through class. I would've conked out if it had lasted much longer. Maybe I should go to bed early after what happened this morning?
Fuuuuuha... Nn?!
...
Makoto? Was she taking supplementary classes, too? She had good grades as far as I knew, so there was no reason for her to take this course...
She stood a fair distance away and took passing glances in my direction.
I didn't know you were taking extra lessons, too, Makoto.
Aaah...! 
Huh? H-Hey!
Makoto quickly scampered off with an embarrassed look on her face.
Oh, that's right... She had given me the silent treatment this morning, and my rice balls were noticeably malformed compared to the other's...
She seemed fairly upset with me before breakfast, too. Should I apologize?
What should I be apologizing for, though? For getting along with Hana? Was that really something I should feel guilty for...?
Makoto's grumpy attitude bothered me once I considered that possibility.
After all, our relationship had become sexual, and we were certainly more than friends. But, then again, Hana and I were...
...Is that it?! 
No, wait. Even though I wasn't dating either of them yet, I could tell Makoto really liked me. It was too soon, though...
Our relationship has crossed a line... Is that why she's mad? That would make sense...
No, no. I need to think about this calmly and rationally. We have{W:700} that{W:0} kind of relationship, and Hana is...
She'd probably be super jealous if she found out... You'd think she'd be angry instead. So it... really is all my fault?! Damn, it is!
B-But... What should I do...?
What are you freaking out about?
Ah, Nee-san.
Call me "Sensei" while we're on campus.
Sensei... It's nothing, really. 
That's true, is it? I always see you as the type to act first, think later.
You make it sound like I don't think things through...
I wouldn't be in this predicament if I had thought things through, though... I was involved with several girls and had become a total sleazeball without realizing it. 
...Haa. 
Buck up! Don't think, just act!
Yes, ma'am! 
...Um, sorry. Sometimes that just isn't enough.
Really? Better to just do it than regret it later. If anything, the Yanushi_Kenta I know isn't that kind of guy.
Nee-san...
"Sensei."
Yeah. You're right. It's exactly like you said, Sensei. It's not like me to regret things later... Yeah! If it bothers me, I should just set out and fix it! 
Yes, that's my Kenta. 
Thanks, Nee-san! 
Hey, didn't I tell you to call me "Sensei"? Jeez...
Hm?
Wait, Yanushi! You still have supplementary lessons to go to! You're still missing credits, you know! Get back here before the break ends!
Ah, he's gone. Honestly, I'm concerned for him, but then he just runs off without warning! What a troublesome boy...
