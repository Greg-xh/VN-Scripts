That's all I have for you today.
All righty! It's my turn to talk now!
Actually, Orteca went missin' last night.
Orteca... Oh, you mean the white cat?
That's Kaya! Orteca's the brown one.
It's a cat, though. It's normal for them to disappear for a few days.
That's right. It'll probably come back on its own soon.
No, no! This is serious stuff we're talkin' about.
My babies hate movin' around more than anythin' else!
They eat and sleep, eat and sleep, and then let the others move 'em! One of them goin' off on its own is impossible!
They're bad cats... just like their owner.
What was that?
Uh, nothing!
What if he's in trouble?!
Trouble? What kind of trouble?
Maybe he got catnapped, and the bad guy will demand a fat stack for it!
I'm a chairwoman, ya know! I've got tons of money! 
Someone's sleazy...
I don't think it's worth the risk of sneaking into the academy...
I agree. If they wanted to extort you, they wouldn't kidnap a cat.
What-e-ver! The fact is, it's missin'!
With that said, I hereby order Kenta-kun to search for Orteca!
Hmm... But, what about the exam? Can I really ditch work for this?
Cat-searchin' is an important job, too!
N-Nee-san... 
Give it up. She can be terribly obstinate, and won't let you off the hook no matter what.
I knew I could count on ya, Fuumin!
Getting complimented for this only makes me more exasperated...
Like I said, that cat hated movin'. So long as he wasn't catnapped, there's a huge chance he's still on campus!
The academy's too big to comb through it alone...
Don't come back without Orteca, ya hear?! Good luck!
Aaah, I think I'm getting a headache...
