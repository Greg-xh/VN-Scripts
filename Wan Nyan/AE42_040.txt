Nekodomari-san, have you seen Onii-chan? He's not in his room. 
He might be in the Kitty Parlor. He said something about staying there for a bit. 
Really? Thank you. 
Don't mention it.
(Onii-chan's definitely a nincompoop, but I'm also at fault.)
(I shouldn't ignore him, and I can tell he feels bad about it, too...)
(And if he went to the Kitty Parlor because I gave him the cold shoulder, he might decide to work there for the rest of the exam...)
(No, that's unacceptable! I should apologize to him.)
(It's always best when we get along, after all!)
