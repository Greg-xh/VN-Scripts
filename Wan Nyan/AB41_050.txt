To think that's how Nono felt about me... 
I needed to seriously consider how I should respond to her confession.
Not just her. Senpai, too.
How did I feel about them? What do I want us to be?
The only thing I could say with absolute certainty is that I had to answer their feelings earnestly. I had to consider this seriously and without regrets.
I never did get the chance to talk to Senpai... I hope I really was just imagining things.
Anyway, I'll handle this tomorrow.
