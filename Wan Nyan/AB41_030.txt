Huh? I've never been to this district before.
Senpai lives around here.
Huh? Really?
Yup, she does.
Don't tell me you knew we'd come this way?
I did, but you're the one who led the way.
R-Really?
Yeah. You randomly decided to walk this way.
Did you do something to force me to come here?
What could I possibly do?
Maybe you put a curse on me?
A curse? I wouldn't do something that awful to you.
Oh, what are you two doing here? 
Senpai?!
Nekohana-san?!
Are you on a date?
Yep, a lovey-dovey date!
Lovey-dovey... Hey, will get you get off my arm?
You don't have to be shy just because Nekohana-san's watching.
What are you talking about...?
Ahaha... You two get along really well.
Because we're lovey-dovey!
Right... Well, I'll be heading back home now. You two have fun on your date. 
We will! Take care.
Mhm...
...
How long are you going to keep watching her?
Senpai looked... upset.
Did she? She looked normal to me.
I don't know... She looked different to me for some reason.
Different how?
I can't put my finger on it, but I can't shake that feeling.
Maybe you're just imagining it? Or maybe she's jealous of how much we get along. 
Mmmm, what could it be...?
Forget that. Let's continue our date!
Yeah... sure.
