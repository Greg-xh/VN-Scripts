...I swear, the chairwoman can be such a handful...
Well, at least you found all the cats...
I didn't "find" them, they were in the office the whole time. 
If anything, the assumption they were gone was wrong to begin with.
While we were busy preparing for another day of work...
"Hey, my faithful peons! I've got a special mission for you today!"
...Was what the chairwoman said as she strung both Hana and me along to look for her cats.
We searched high and low for the cats, but the chairwoman quickly lost interest and returned to her office to find Makoto waiting for her.
The cats were in the office the whole time.
Makoto had been playing with the cats in anticipation for the chairwoman's return. 
The chairwoman was half-asleep at the time and didn't notice the sleeping kitties. She left so fast, I'm sure the cats were kind of shocked.
Half-asleep...? It's the middle of a work day! What a crummy adult.
Agreed... The cats are cute, though. They're so round, soft, and squishy. 
Yeah, they are pretty cute. Adorable, even.
That's right, cats are cute. Heheh.
Hmmm...
...!
Hana suddenly glared at Makoto sharply.
Someone's awfully full of herself...
Mm..?
You seemed awfully arrogant after Yanushi-kun agreed with you!
What are you talking about? 
How shameless! Just you wait, I'll have you on your hands and knees by the end of the day! Say your prayers now before it's too late!
Hana pointed her index figure vigorously at Makoto.
I have no idea what you're trying to beat me at... But good luck, I guess. Toodles. 
Leaving behind that nonchalant comment, Makoto left with a disinterested expression.
Hey... Wh...! Wait, you!
Makoto ignored Hana's cries and retreated into the distance.
Come on, Hana. Stop messing with...
I am{W:700} not{W:0} messing with her!
...And now I was the one on the receiving end of her anger.
Ahaha... Yeah.
I gave her a vague, yet reluctant nod.
