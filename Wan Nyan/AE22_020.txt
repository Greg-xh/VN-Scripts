Hello and welcome to Beans Puppy. 
Female Customer A
Hellooo, we're heeeere. 
Oh...
Female Customer A
Mmm? What is it? 
It's nothing, pardon me. We have an open table there, by the window.
Female Customer B
Wow! Look at all the dogs. Is this Heaven?!
Female Customer A
Yes, yes. We know. Come on already!
Female Customer B
Noooo, let me touuuuuch theeeeem!
Female Customer A
You can do that later! Just sit down.
Female Customer B
Doggies, puppiiiiiies~!
...Okay!
That customer is here!
This is it!
The time has come.
Please help me out!
Of course. Let's give that young lady a memory she'll never be able to forget!
Heh. This is a first for us, so it's only natural we'd be nervous.
All right! Let's do it just like we practiced!
Yes!
Female Customer B
Whoa, the doggies are just so cute...! The Chihuahua is freakin' adorable. Maybe I should adopt one...?
Female Customer A
You've got seven dogs already. 
Female Customer B
I'd welcome having a bigger family!
Female Customer A
You're always whining about having no money after feeding them... 
Female Customer B
I'll live off of nothing but bread and water starting tomorrow, then!
Female Customer A
Down, girl...
Female Customer B
Haah, this place really is amazing... I didn't know such a wonderful store was in my neighborhood...
Female Customer A
I figured you'd like it here. 
Female Customer B
Mnah! I owe you my life, my darling!
Female Customer A
There's still more to come!
Female Customer B
Huh? What do you mean?
Female Customer A
Heehee. 
Thank you for waiting. I have your special birthday cake right here. 
Female Customer A
Here it is! 
Female Customer B
Wh-What is this?! This is amazing! Is today someone's birthday?
Female Customer A
It's your birthday, dummy. What's wrong with you?
Female Customer B
Oh, right... I totally forgot.
Female Customer A
Yeah, figured you would...
Our staff would like to celebrate this special day with you.
A one, two...
Everyone
Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday, Nanako-san. Happy birthday to you!
Everyone
Happy birthday!
Nanako
Th-Thank you! I can't believe how wonderful this cake is... This is the best birthday I've ever had!
Female Customer A
It's not that big of a deal.
Nanako
It is to me! Look at these decorations! It's so cute, and eating it feels like a huge waste. I'll take a picture of it for safekeeping.
Female Customer A
No, eat it or it'll go bad. 
Nanako
May I take a picture?
Yes, of course. 
Nanako
Yay!
Female Customer C
Um, excuse me? May I take a picture of it, too?
Whoa! When did we attract a crowd?!
Nanako
Go ahead. It wouldn't be fair to hog a cake this cute all to myself. Feel free to take pictures.
Female Customer C
Thank you!
Female Customer D
Wow, look at it! It must've taken forever to make that.
Female Customer C
It was a surprise, apparently! They offered to make us one too if we ask.
Female Customer D
Really?! My birthday already passed, though...
Female Customer C
Got a great shot of it! I'll upload it online in a second!
Female Customer D
Me too, me too! I'll tell all my friends about this place!
Nanako
I've never had such a wonderful birthday before. I'm so happy, I feel like I'm gonna cry.
Nanako
Thank you so, so much!
