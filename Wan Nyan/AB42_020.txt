Female Customer
Huh? This isn't what I ordered.
I-I'm sorry! I'll replace this right away!
Female Customer
Don't worry about it. This looks great, too, so I'll still eat it!
Are you sure?
Female Customer
Positive!
My apologies... 
That was a pretty novice mistake for her to make... That wasn't like her.
Watch out, Senpai! Tai's in the way!
Huh? Oh no... Kyaa!
In her attempt to evade Tai, who had been rolling about on the floor, Senpai tripped over her own feet and lost her balance in a rather spectacular fashion.
Senpai failed to stay upright and fell on her backside.
Senpai!
Meow! 
O-Ouch... I hit my butt... 
Are you okay?!
Forget me, what about Tai?
He's fine. He got scared and ran off somewhere.
Oh, that's good... 
I can't say the same for you, though. 
I'm fine, I'm fine. I just hurt my butt a little.
What's wrong?
Huh? Wh-What?
I don't want to be rude, but you've been making mistakes all day long.
Ahaha. You caught me on a bad day. It's nothing, really.
It doesn't look that way to me. You've been acting weird since earlier... no, since yesterday. 
You're imagining things... Ah, a customer's calling, so I'll be going. 
Senpai!
I knew it. Something{W:700} was{W:0} wrong...
