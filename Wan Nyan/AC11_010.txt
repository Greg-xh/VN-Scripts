Thank you for coming!
Phew! Good, good. I'm relieved we've had a steady flow of customers today.
Yeah. I was a bit nervous, but everything's going surprisingly well.
Hey! What do you mean by, "Surprising"? That's rude. It's all thanks to our cute kitties and waitress staff!
Like a certain someone standing right in front of you... Right?
Absolutely! Just so, so cute...
Huh?! Um, what? Ah, r-right... I guess, well, I did have to go on a bit of a diet to fit into this uniform, but...
Really, really cute...
Ah...?!
K-Kenta-kun...?
Meow!
Yeah! The dogs and cats are super adorable!
I was skeptical about having them around at first, but...
They're really obedient if someone looks after them, though. All of us, including the customers, seem more relaxed with them around, too. Good boy!
Purr~@
Oh... The cats, huh? The cats... Not the waitresses. You really suck at listening to people, don't you...?
Huh? Why are you mumbling?
Aaaah! It's nothing, really! Forget about that; we're almost out of cakes in the show window!
Oh, right. We weren't expecting so many customers to order takeout. We'll run out before closing at this rate.
I'll ask the others in the kitchen to whip up some more, and offer to help out if they need it.
Yeah, please do. Don't forget, you're supposed to be manning the front of the store today!
Right. I'm off, then!
Yeah, thank you!
...
I swear, he's got cake for brains. He's all smiles the second you mention anything about baking.
He ignores me and other cute girls because of it...
Meow?
It's nothing. I just don't like being so low on his priority list compared to cakes and cats, that's all...
Meoow~
