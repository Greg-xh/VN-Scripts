It's pretty quiet. 
Yes, but stuff like this can be fun, too.
This sort of thing doesn't bother you, huh?
I{W:700} do{W:0} think it's got a strong atmosphere, but I'm not scared.
Does that mean you don't believe in ghosts?
No. If anything, I hope they do exist!
Really?
Yes, doesn't meeting one sound really fun?
Fun? Not scary?
Yes. Is that weird? 
It's not weird, just a little unusual. 
It's wonderful to meet new people. It expands your world and teaches you new things. I love that feeling!
Meeting a ghost would expand your world... I can't imagine it, but it's great that you have such a positive outlook on it.
And that's why I'm grateful I got to meet you, Ken-chan. 
You gave me the chance to be exposed to the world of sweets.
Meeting you and Master taught me a great deal, too. New encounters really are important.
Yes! Everyone I've met through this exam, including the customers, are all very important to me.
Yeah. Meeting new people really is a once-in-a-lifetime thing. Every person you come across is important.
You've made me realize that, Hina. Thank you.
Heheheh, you're welcome. 
Well, we're at the goal. 
There's something written on the blackboard.
Let's see. Each of us is supposed to take a cookie from that jar on the table, and head back to the dining hall from this route...
I see... Let's take a cookie and head back, then.
Yes.
