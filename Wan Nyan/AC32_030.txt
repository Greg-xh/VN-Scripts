Mmm, nnn... Muha, nnn...!
Phew... Haa, haa.
Heehee... I thought you wouldn't kiss me, but you did. 
That's, uhh... courtesy, I guess. 
Courtesy? Heehee... Is it, now?
After we finished making love, Makoto licked away the semen from her hand and, as promised, lapped greedily at my cock with her lips and tongue.
Makoto swallowing my dick only made me hard, but stopped short after we heard Senpai yelling, "Hurry up and take a bath" from outside the room.
I somehow managed to fool Senpai into thinking nothing was wrong and, after she left, waited a few minutes before exiting the room.
Someone might see us if you kiss me right now...
No, erm... I was thinking it might be okay if it did end up that way...
Huh...?
Does that mean... 
Ah?! Um, it's nothing. I should really go take a bath... or Senpai might come back. Bye!
Aaah, Kenta!
Jeez... How can he be so thick? I guess it's kinda cute, though...
But the only thing on my mind now is... "Kenta, Kenta, Kenta, Kenta! I love you!"
Yeah, I won't lose to either Korone-san or Hana. I'll have to work hard tomorrow, too... Right, Kenta? Heehee.
My feelings may well have been decided long before this. 
But I wasn't honest or bold enough to put those feelings into words yet... 
That put me in quite a bind, but it wasn't something I needed to worry about for the time being.
