Turn to page sixty-eight of your textbook. It describes the sort of food poisoning you should watch out for around this time of year.
The sound of pages being turned filled the classroom. 
It was summer vacation and, while classes weren't typically held, we were stuck taking supplementary lessons.
Only half of the class was filled as they listened intently to Nee-san's lecture.
Many of these students couldn't attend classes due to work or otherwise. Those who flunked their tests could take these supplementary lessons to get the necessary credits to graduate.
I met all those criteria. I skipped school often due to my training, but still lacked the credits despite my high skill level.
This class was a real lifesaver. By participating in this course, I got those extra, necessary credits.
That concludes that topic. Next, turn to page one hundred twenty-four. We're jumping ahead a bit, but make sure to review the material leading up to it on your own.
All the students replied in agreement. Anyway, I won't get the credits if I don't buckle down. Falling asleep wasn't an option, either.
That would be... really bad...
Nn... I hate this topic. I'm getting sleepy... Fuha!
