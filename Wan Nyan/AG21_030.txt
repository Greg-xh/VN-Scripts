Phew... I busted my butt today.
We worked all day from morning until close.
I was exhausted, but it wasn't a mental sort of exhaustion that made me sad or depressed. It was like being tired after playing your favorite sport.
After praising the rest of the team for their hard work, I returned to my room, changed out of my uniform, then rolled into bed and stared at the ceiling.
Hmm... Being busy every day is a good thing. I get to do what I love and with people I get along with...
I sighed when I gradually considered the various encounters I'd experienced with those around me.
This was a happy training period of sorts. Whatever the end result may be, I wanted to cherish every day and make sweets to the best of my ability. That's what I hoped for.
With that said, my stomach was grumbling. I worked really hard today and was starting to run out of energy.
(I should probably eat something... I haven't had dinner yet. I'd better eat, take a bath, and go to bed early. Staying healthy and having good hygiene is important for an artisan.)
I made my way to the dining hall.
