Kenta-kun, Shinono-chan. 
On your way back to the dorms, Senpai?
Yeah, I had to take care of some stuff at home. Are you two going somewhere?
Yeah, we're going on a date!
A date...?
Not sure where we want to go yet, but that's the plan for now.
O-Oh...
Onii-chan, can we hold hands while we walk?
I don't mind, but that will slow us down a little.
Why not carry me like a princess, then?
That will only make it worse.
Fine, you can just hold my hand.
Yeah, yeah. Thank you, my lady.
Hehe, your hand is so big.
Where did{W:700} that{W:0} come from?
I was just thinking out loud.
We're heading out now, Senpai.
Huh? O-Oh, yeah. Have fun. 
Yeah, and we'll have loads of fun on our date!
Ahaha...
...
...It's come down to that, huh?
I won't lose. I've got to give it my all!
