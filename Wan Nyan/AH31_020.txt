All right. 
Senpai turned the stove's temperature down.
Today was... a long day. It wasn't too bad compared to other days, though.
Well, the chairwoman left pretty early this time. 
It wasn't so much that she left as she was forcefully evicted... 
She'll probably be back tomorrow, too...
Ahaha... Most likely. It'd be nice if she could help out again, though.
We wouldn't be having so much trouble if she were kind enough to do that.
...Now that you mention it, the chairwoman's cake.
Huh?
If you look... Our customers have been ordering items that were similar to what the chairwoman made the other day.
I see... It practically made a name for itself overnight from how good it was...
Everyone fell silent.
I didn't get the chance to taste the chairwoman's cake, either.
If rumors of it had spread that quickly among our customer base, then...
We weren't able to replicate that cake's flavor, though... 
Well, let's head back!
Senpai chimed in, as if to break the silence.
With no reason to stick around, we closed up shop and returned to the chairwoman's office.
