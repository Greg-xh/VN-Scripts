Was Makoto some kind of ace detective? It was kind of scary how she saw through everything so easily. 
She was wrong about who I liked, but everything else was spot-on.
I thought this would stay between me and Nono, but it ended up causing problems for the people around us. What should I do?
How had Senpai felt after hearing that? Should I have denied it a little more?
Concerned, I subconsciously scanned the cafe for Senpai.
Female Customer
Huh, did I order this? I remember ordering a gateau chocolat. 
I-I'm sorry! I'll have this fixed right away!
Female Customer
All right. Please do.
My apologies...
Female Customer
No worries, we all make mistakes sometimes.
Thank you... 
Female Customer
Oh, miss, there's a cat under you! A cat!
What? Whoa, M-Morta!
Meooooow!
O-O-Ouch... I fell on my butt.
Female Customer
Are you all right? 
I-I'm sorry... I keep messing up...
Female Customer
It's fine, but please be careful.
Yes, thank you so much... 
...Not to be self-conscious, but was she like this because of me?
This was bad, as it was quickly influencing everyone else around us. I had to think of something, and fast!
