Want to take a quick break?
Sure.
I'm sorry for dragging you out here like this.
It's really okay.
Why did you need to go home in the first place, especially at this hour?
BreｩU-Uh...! I-It wasn't important!
Running the store sure is fun, huh? I look forward to it every morning.
Same here. There's so much to learn. I couldn't be happier.
I agree. The exam has been good for us... It's a shame they hadn't done it in so long.
It sucks for those who attended the academy while it was abolished.
Yeah, we really are lucky. 
Yeah. I don't know why they decided to bring it back, but I'm grateful they did.
It's too bad. All those customers come to see us, but we won't be open for much longer...
Some people like pop-up stores, but we'll be shutting down once summer break ends. I feel bad...
Yeah. They'll reopen the stores if they host the exam again next year.
I'm graduating next year regardless, so I won't be able to experience this again.
Ah, that's right... I'm sure your fans will come back and try your sweets while they still can.
I don't have any fans.
Seriously? I'm a fan of yours, for starters. A{W:700} huge{W:0} fan, actually!
Flattery will get you nowhere.
That's not it. I'm being serious.
Your sweets have the power to make people happy. 
Huh? They do?
Yeah. There's still so much left for you to teach me!
It makes me happy to hear you say that... I'll work hard so I can meet your expectations!
Anyway, let's talk about something else...
Like what?
Did something happen between you and Shinono-chan?
Something...? What do you mean?
I just... Shinono-chan's been... acting a bit strange lately.
Really? She's the same as usual as far as I can tell... What changed?
The way she looks at you.
How she looks at me?
Yeah. I'm probably imagining things... Sorry for asking something so weird.
Not a big deal.
Hmmm... It's getting chilly, so let's head back.
Yeah, let's go back to the dorms.
