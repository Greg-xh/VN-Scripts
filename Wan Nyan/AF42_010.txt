Hmm.
She's late. 
I checked my cell phone again.
It was... ten minutes past the appointed time. 
There was no point in a rendezvous, especially since we lived in the same dorm, but she insisted.
Had she overslept...?
As an artisan, she was always diligent and on time for work, so I assumed the same could be said for her private life, too...
...
...
...
What's going on? She didn't get caught up in something bad, right...?
Huh...?
Isn't that... 
I could see a familiar figure hiding behind a telephone pole. 
Hey, Ha_
As I was about to call Hana's name and walk up to her, she hid. 
Oh. 
I think I see where this is going. 
I turned my back to the telephone pole, and... 
Gee, Hana sure is late! I wonder where she could be?!
And just as I said that out loud...
???
Yanushi-kuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun!
I turned around abruptly. 
Haa... Haa... Haa... Haa... Haa... 
Hana pretended to be out of breath, almost like she'd run here.
W-Were you waiting long?
Um... No, well, yeah. But...
I started to say, exasperated, but Hana pointed a finger at me.
You're supposed to say "I only just showed up myself" right now! 
Huh?
With one hand "hidden" behind her back, I could see she was holding onto the book from last time, "First Dates for the Clueless Maiden! Tsundere Edition."
She was still relying on that? Well, whatever. I played along accordingly.
Yeah, "I only just showed up myself."
Ahaha, you did?
Hana looked quite delighted, which was when I changed topics.
Well, whatever... Where do we go today?
I don't know.
Huh...?
I didn't make any plans.
Uh, but... why...?
As far as I am concerned, spending time with you is the most important thing. What we're doing isn't as important.
I... I see... 
Hmm. I figured she'd follow the instructions in the book, but I guess not?
Or maybe it told her to not be so picky and she's going in blind.
Well, it really didn't matter.
All right! Let's head for the station and check out some random stuff. Are you okay with that?
Okey-dokey!
And so, we walked to the station together.
