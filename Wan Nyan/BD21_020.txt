Mmm... 
What, aren't you going? 
It wasn't enough. 
What do you mean?
I haven't eaten enough... My tummy's rumbling... 
After you ate all that...? That's kinda scary. I always wonder where all that food goes in that skinny body of yours.
Anyway, what are you going to do? 
I thought I'd fix myself something to eat. 
I'll help you, then. 
Really? 
I wouldn't have anything else to do if I were to go back to my room.
Can you make me three more cakes, like the ones you made earlier?
Three cakes... A-All right.
