Ah...
"Ah"?
No... I mean, you're the only one here?
Do you see anyone else here? If you do, you need to get your head examined.
Well, you're not wrong...
Everyone else was busy, so they come and go at different times.
Really? Wow...
...
Aaaah, she's still mad at me... We can't stay like this. I have to get her to forgive me somehow!
Man, it sure is nice out today!
I guess.
So, uh... I'm sorry about last time.
...
I'll do anything you want, so please forgive me.
...Anything?
Anything I can realistically do. 
Hmm...
So, uhh... Nono?
Do you remember what I said to you before?
When you wanted me to look at you more and treat you as someone special?
If you do that, I'll forgive you. 
What do you want me to do, exactly?
Have sex with me.
And that'll make you feel special?
Not really, but you're looking at me and only me when we have sex. I{W:700} am{W:0} the only one you think about, right?
Absolutely.
Let's do it, then. If we have sex enough times, maybe you'll start seeing me as someone special.
Remember what you said just now, about doing "anything you realistically can"? Are you going back on that?
Of course not!
And you're really okay with that?
Yeah, I'll keep that promise. 
All right, let's do it.
