You look like you're having fun. 
...!
Did... I say something to upset you?
No... I'm having fun. Going out together like this, without anyone else around to bother us, was far lovelier than I imagined!
Oh yeah? It might sound weird coming from me, but let's focus on our outing today and not on work.
I replied with a wry smile.
...Th-That... is a good idea. Yes...
Squeeze. 
The palm of Hana's hand closed tightly around mine.
Um... Is your house nearby, Yanushi-kun?
Hmm? Yeah, I think it's about a ten minute walk from here.
R-Really...? Why are you staying at the dorms, then? 
I wouldn't mind commuting, but... the academy wants to keep me on a short leash. Probably so I don't run off again to train somewhere.
Aha! Ahaha!
I mean, I'm not a three-year-old. I'm not gonna run off after they put me in charge of a store.
But I think I understand where the academy is coming from... In regards to trying to keep you in one place...
Huh? What did you say?
No, it was nothing. Anyway, we've never spoken about this sort of thing before.
Up until now, we haven't had time to talk about anything other than work.
We kept talking and the distance between us gradually grew smaller...

...So, what were we shopping for, again?
Didn't I mention it before? We're shopping for spring clothes.
Right, you did say that.
We're supposed to be in uniform while on campus, but otherwise we're free to wear whatever we want. Since I'll be here for a while, having other clothes handy wouldn't be a bad idea. 
I see... I don't know where you could buy women's clothes, so maybe we should've invited Senpai to join us...
N-No, it's fine! 
Huh...?
Come on, let's go! 
Hana tugged on my arm.
I only need you to show me around the shopping district, Yanushi-kun! 
R-Right... I guess we can start by checking out the stores near the station.
At Hana's insistence, she pulled me by the arm and escorted me down the road.
