I can't eat anymore... Omnomnom... 
Um... Everyone's asleep. Makes sense, given the time.
We seem to have lost track of time after having such a nice, long chat.

What? Did I have a creepy look on my face?
That kind of thinking won't do.
Huh? Did I do something wrong?

Hm? What's wrong with that?
I don't want you to look at other girls like that...
I realize how selfish that sounds, but I can't help how I feel...
I want you to look at me and no one else... At least for now...
Hana?
