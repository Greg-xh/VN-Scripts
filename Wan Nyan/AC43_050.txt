At that time...
Gather around, everyone! It's time to eat! Today you get old Korone's cat food special!
Kittens
Meow, meow~!
Kittens
Meow, meow~!
Hehe! Make sure to eat plenty so you can grow up big and strong! You'll be as big as a lion!
Meow~!
They'd destroy the whole store if that happened... Along with the rest of the academy.
No, no, it'll just become a lion caf｣ and prosper. Wait, Makoto-chan?!
What's wrong? I thought you and the others were tailing Kenta-kun?
Yeah, I thought about it but changed my mind. I decided to trust Kenta instead.
Right.
...
...
Do you trust him, Korone-san?
Of course I do. I'm his Senpai, after all.
...
Your lover might get snatched away.
We're not lovers. At least, I don't know if Kenta-kun thinks of me that way. He'd never give me the time of day.
Really? I always thought of you as my biggest rival. When I first came here, everyone seemed to have feelings for Kenta...
Even so, I wasn't going to lose to anyone.
...Haa. No, to be honest, I didn't think I had a chance.
...Makoto-chan?
I mean, you're all much prettier and mature than me... Ah, except for Inukai-san. She's not as mature, but she's got the cute thing going for her. 
I thought I was the ugliest girl here... Ah, maybe second ugliest next to Hana. Maybe... just a little.
Heehee. Don't worry, Makoto-chan. You're really cute!
Th-Thanks. That makes me kind of happy, but everyone's rushing to achieve their dreams and has their sights set on Kenta.
I only ever think about myself, sweets, and Nekonoya.
Kenta's my ideal partner. Together we could climb to the top! ...Heh, that's not loving him. That's not even liking him. 
I always thought I was ugly, but that's changed recently...
It changed?
Yeah. He's had a big impact on me... He's always on my mind, and my heart skips a beat whenever I think about him...
That's love for you, meow! Hehe.
A-Ah, err! You knew that Kenta and I are, uhh, that? 
...Kind of? You know how obvious Kenta-kun can be. He's too honest and pure.
If extremely thickheaded. 
Right, right! That's what makes him cute, though. Besides, if he knowingly tried to go out with all of us, he'd be a total womanizer.
Yep, that's exactly right. Hehe.
...
...
Is it really okay for me to take him?
Of course. It's ultimately up to him, but I'll give you my blessing as his senpai.
...
And how do you feel?
I'm super angry! Why did he have to pick you?! I just wanna walk up to him and give him a long, hard noogie until he cries and apologizes!
Yikes, that sounds painful.
For sure! Ah, right. I should do that to you, too! You're the homewrecking kitty cat who stole Kenta-kun from me, after all!
...
...
Go ahead, just try not to make it too painful.
...
Heheh, ahahaha! I'm kidding, I'm kidding! I'm not gonna give you a noogie or hurt you. 
But... I might cry myself to sleep later.
Korone-san...?
Haah, all this talk about upper and underclassmen... I'm so stupid. I put all this distance between me and Kenta-kun when all I wanted was the opposite.
I was too afraid to touch him and didn't know how to tie him down... I was his upperclassmen and that's it. I'm such a coward for it.
...
But Kenta... hasn't told me how he feels yet.
Do you need him to? In that case, make him say it! Tell him to say that he loves you.
If that happens, I'll be your nagging sister-in-law! I'll support you guys, so... do your best, Makoto-chan.
Yeah. Thank you, Senpai. 
Senpai? 
You're the Senpai who used to love Kenta.
Hehe. Well, "used" isn't right. I still do, and always will. So you better watch out! You've still got plenty of rivals, y'know?
Yes, I won't forget that.
