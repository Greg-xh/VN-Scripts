At least I know it's not in one of the stores.
That doesn't really narrow down where it could be, though... This place is too big, damn it.
Haaaaaaaaa...
She's quite troublesome, isn't she?
Nee-san. 
I'd love to help, but I have to run some errands. I'm sorry.
It's not your fault, Nee-san. 
It's my responsibility for not reining in the chairwoman's selfish personality. 
If only I'd disciplined her more back when we were students...
Ahaha...
About the cat, like the chairwoman said, it's lazier than you'd ever imagine a cat could be.
It's horribly similar to its mistress, and doesn't have a wild bone in its body.
What kind of cat is that?
It hating moving so much, it wouldn't even think of going out into the summer sun.
Does that mean it's still indoors?
Possibly...? No, it almost certainly is.
Given its behavior, I doubt it would even make it off campus. 
Yikes, that's one lazy cat. 
Uhh... That just leaves the dormitories, then?
Yeah, that's my guess.
Ooh, then that narrows it down by a lot! Thanks! 
No need to thank me. Just wrap this up and get back to work as soon as possible.
Roger! I'm off! 
Good luck.
