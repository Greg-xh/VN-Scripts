Mmmmaaaah... 
I yawned repeatedly as I made my way to Rui-san's office for our morning briefing.
Yo!
Just as I entered the room...
Oh, you're early! 
Huh?!
Even though we'd had sex the night before, Rui-san shot me a malice-free smile.
Haha... Ahahahaha... Yeah, I guess... 
With that vague reply, I scanned my surroundings and discovered we were alone...
A-Awkwaaaaard... If I'd known this was going to happen, I'd have deliberately shown up late...
Now lost in thought, I restlessly examined my surroundings.
Heeheehee...
Hm?
Heehee... Hehehehe...
Rui-san kept staring at me!
Wh-What...?
Oh, nothin'... I was just thinkin' about how ya really did steal my virginity.
Wha...?! 
An odd squeak leapt out of my throat.
Wh-Wh-Whaaaat?! Y-You got drunk and forced yourself on me!
I didn't force ya to do anythin'.
You barged into my room and seduced me! 
You're a strong guy and could've pushed me away, but ya didn't. This ripe, mature body was just too irresistible, huh?
Ripe, mature body...?
Ugh... Ripe...? 
Those words spiraled around in my brain and gradually lost their meaning.
Could you really call Rui-san's body... ripe...?
Um... Try not to dwell on it too much, okay?
No, if anything, you should take this more seriously!
I-I'm trying to! Y'know... I've got a lot on my mind... 
Like what?
I mean... I ended up... showing ya pretty much everything...
....!
My face flared up immediately. 
Seeing Rui-san's ripe, mature body... No! I mean... Her mature, bombshell of an{W:700} adult{W:0} body... Ah, wait, what?
Um, uh, seeing her flat and curveless was still embarrassing.
Well, I wanna know if ya thought anythin' looked weird...
Ah... No, nothing looked particularly off about it...
I'd be lying if I said there wasn't something lacking about her petite physique...
But... maybe ya thought my body was lackin' something...
I-I didn't!
I shook my head in desperation.
My heart thundered wildly in my chest.
How did she always manage to see right through me...?!
I clutched my chest tightly with that thought in mind, but Rui-san simply flashed me an innocent smile.
Right... I'm glad. 
Huh...?
Thump!
My already excited heart skipped yet another beat.
I get it now... Rui-san obviously had some underlying complex about her body.
The chairwoman was always so easygoing. Combine that with her innocent, mischievous nature, as well as her inability to stand out...
Underneath all of that, she had some serious qualms about her appearance.
When I realized she buried those worries and acted cheerful in spite of that... It made me appreciate the woman in front of me much more than I ever thought possible.
Kenta-kun... How did my naked body look to ya?
W-Well, it was pretty. 
I answered honestly. 
Did it turn ya on?
W-Well yeah, obviously it did!
I, once again, answered honestly. 
Would ya want to sleep with me again?
Um, yeah. I'd like to...
I stammered back.
Really?
Huh? Oh, ah... Yeah, really.
I replied, slightly tiredly. 
I see...
Heehee...
Rui-san smiled innocently again. 
Well, jeez... But, whatever... 
I wondered to myself. 
I couldn't understand why the chairwoman chose this job, but...
Maybe this heartwarming innocence and charisma was necessary for a person who was in charge of other people...?
Hmm, Kenta-kun?
You've got nothing to worry about. You're a great, mature woman.
Aaah, Kenta-kun. Wait a sec... 
No need to be shy, Rui-san. You have a gorgeous body!
Heeheehee... I'm happy to hear that, but... 
Her expression gradually grew darker the more I spoke.
Mm? Maybe she's weak to compliments...?
And just as I thought of that... 
???
Yaaaanuuuushiiiiiiiiii?!
Huh...?
That voice seemed to echo up at me from the depths of hell. 
I turned around and faced the owner of that voice.
Yanuuuuushiiiiiiii? What did you just say...?!
Haaaah...?!
Uh-oh... Ya just said that in front of Fuumin...
...Hey, don't act like it has nothing to do with you!
Oh, I see... So you're both accomplices here...
Wait, Fuumin, weren't ya spyin' on us from the start? I{W:700} did{W:0} say, "Ya really did steal my virginity."
Why are you throwing me under the bus?! Don't forget, I said "You got drunk and forced yourself on me!"
Aah! You're the traitor, here! 
Me?! 
Ugh, shut up!
Rui&Kenta
....!
We quickly fell silent and Nee-san continued.
Well... I can take a guess at what happened...
Aha... Ahahahaha, I regret everythin'! I won't do it again. 
Nee-san pointed a vicious glare in Rui-san's direction at her blatantly fake apology.
Care to explain what happened...?
Overpowered by her infuriated voice, we had no choice but to talk... 
...
...And, well, that's about it.
...W-Well, that's pretty much what I assumed... Kuh... Ugh. 
Nee-san took off her glases and rubbed the space between her eyes.
Deplorable... To think I was so close by... Did you even consider your positions as teacher and student? How indecent...!
Now, now, Fuumin... I'm sure a knight in shinin' armor will come for ya someday, too!
Don't pity me for such foolish reasons!
Huh? Weren't ya always gunnin' for a prince of your own? You've always wanted a man to pamper yaｩ
Shut your mouth this instant! 
Um... Could you{W:700} not{W:0} add anymore fuel to the fire...?
Yanushi! 
Ah...?!
W-Was I the target now...?!
I'd assume you're serious about this relationship if you've taken it this far?
...Huh?
Don't you "Huh" me. You didn't touch her just because you want to fool around, right...?!
O-Of course not. 
Good, take responsibility for this if you're a man!
R-Responsibility...? 
You don't intend to...?
She glared daggers at me again. 
Ah... N-No, I... I'll take responsibility for this, of course... 
It didn't look like the conversation would end anytime soon if I said otherwise.
...
For the time being, Nee-san fell silent and I sighed in relief internally. 
And then...
Good morning! 
Fumiko & Rui & Kenta
...?!?!?!?!
Hm? Is something wrong?
N-No, nothing!
Huh? Ken-chan, you sure are early today. 
...Thanks to everyone finally showing up, the situation was safely defused...
