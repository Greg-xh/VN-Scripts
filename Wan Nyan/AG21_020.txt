And... there, it's ready! Now, the next one...
A few minutes later_
Nono left the kitchen with a bandage on her knee, and I was focused on making more cakes.
It may sound egotistical, but my work was flawless. I moved swiftly, accurately, and fluidly.
As impressive as ever. You can make one cake after another without skipping a beat... They all look tasty, too.
I'm honestly amazed whenever I watch you work. It's no wonder why you're recognized as the greatest culinary genius in the academy's history... Your skill is genuine and lovely...
Oooh, rave reviews, I see. It does feel good... 
This is no flattery. I merely described what I feel... 
I see. Thanks, Hana. You really upped my motivation. 
Hana's kind words made me want to say something along the lines of, "Compliments will get you nowhere! Here, have some pocket money!" like some nice, old uncle.
However... 
Hmph... 
...
...Tch... 
Another young woman stood nearby and watched me work, her complete disinterest a stark contrast to Hana's glowing praise.
When I glanced in Michiyo-san's direction, she turned her face away sharply.
