W-We're finally back... 
W-We're safe! We made it back alive...!
Are you okay? You're as white as a ghost.
If you think{W:700} this{W:0} is "all right," then go to the hospital and get your stupid head examined.
I-It wasn't{W:700} that{W:0} scary! I thought it would be worse. 
Your knees are shaking. 
They are most certainly not! 
Hehehe. Micchan's so cute when she's scared. Makes me want to glomp her and lick her ears...
Haaa... Haah... Need water...
She's too out of it to even make a comeback...
I didn't think you'd be this scared. 
I said as much at the start...
I thought we could do some party games after, but I don't think you're quite up for it...
It's a shame, but let's call it good for today. I'll try to think of something everyone can enjoy next time.
Please do... 
This concludes our test of courage. Thanks, everyone! That is all!
That ended sooner than I thought it would... Oh well, I can go back and relax in my room for a bit.
Ken-chan, I've got something I need to say. Can we talk?
Sure. Want to come back to my room?
Yes.
