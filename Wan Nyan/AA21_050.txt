Oh, going somewhere?
Yeah. Having trouble sleeping, so I figured going on a walk would help.
Are you nervous about tomorrow?
No way, you're not that kind of guy, Kenta-kun.
Maybe you've just got too much pent-up energy?
Yeah, something like that. 
Aren't you used to it by now, though? You worked at several places while traveling.
Sure, but I helped other people run{W:700} their{W:0} stores.
I've never managed my own shop before, so I just can't sit still.
Man, I can't wait for tomorrow! 
Heheh, you're so dependable.
You don't look nervous at all, Senpai.
Well, I've been helping out at my family's bakery for as long as I can remember.
From where I'm standing,{W:700} you're{W:0} the dependable one.
Mind if I join in on your walk?
Sure, go ahead. 
Thanks! Talk about great timing. I wanted to get some fresh air anyway.
Let's go, then. 
Mhm!
Wait up!
Nono? What's wrong?
Where are you two going?!
We're just going on a quick walk.
I'm going with you!
I don't mind... What do you think, Senpai?
The more the merrier! I'm tagging along, too.
Thanks a bunch, Nekohana-san.
No need to thank me. 
Let's take a break.
Aren't nighttime walks kind of exciting?
Mhm, I know what you mean! 
You think so, too?
Yeah! 
Don't do it too often, though. It's dangerous for a girl to walk alone at night.
I'll be fine as long as you're with me!
Your dad would kill me if anything happened to you, Nono... But I'll keep you company every now and then.
You'll "keep me company," huh? That's a bit condescending. 
Well, I'm kind of like your guardian, you know?
You don't need to be. That's what Onee-chan's for.
Hmm... I mean, yeah, Nee-san's more dependable, but...
Heh, you two get along so well. Almost like you're real siblings.
We're not exactly on the best of terms right now, though.
Did something happen? It's not nice for you to bully people, Kenta. 
I didn't do anything! 
That's a lie! You trampled on my innocent heart, you monster!
Kenta-kuuuuun?
Like I said, I didn't do anything! I'm innocent!
Let me know if he ever does anything to you, okay?
Thank you so much! 
Onii-chan!
Wh-What?
I'm thirsty, so go buy me juice! 
Huh?
Just do it! If you don't, I'll share all of your embarrassing secrets with Nekohana-san!
Ugh, that's unfair... Fine, I'll go. What do you want to drink?
Apple juice.
And you, Senpai?
Huh? Oh, hmm, a sports drink would be nice.
Gotcha. I'll be right back.
...
Now that he's gone, I've got something important to say.
What is it?
I'm... not going to lose!
Huh? Oh, you mean the exam?
Not that! I'm talking about Onii-chan.
Remember when I said I liked someone? Well, it's Onii-chan...
Huh? Hmm... Wait, what do you mean?
I... really like Onii-chan. I mean,{W:700} really{W:0} like-like him! As a boy...
Shinono-chan... 
So... I'm not backing down. That's all I wanted to say.
I... I won't lose, either.
Then it's a race!
That's right... I don't intend to lose to you or anyone else.
I accept your challenge! 
Wait, a race? Can I join in, too?
You came back too soon! Onii-chan, you nincompoop!
Such cruel and unusual treatment...
Anyway, what's this about a race?
We can't tell you since it's an important girls-only event, Kenta-kun.
Hmm... Fine, I guess.
