Business has been booming today, too.
With how many customers we've been bringing in, I'll have Makoto on her hands and knees before she knows it!
Your ambition is admirable, but it's time to go back.
Fair enough. Good job, everyone!
Yes, fine work today. 
Bye, everyone!
...
Hm? You're not going back to the dorms?
I want you to help me make a new dish.
Sure, I don't mind. 
All right. Thanks.
Yeah, leave it to me!
...
Okay, the cream is done!
...
Er... You've been awfully quiet this whole time.
I wasn't quiet. 
It seemed like you were.
Do you want to talk, then? 
Oh. Sure, about what? 
Tell me about Nekohana-san. 
Senpai? What about her? 
Tell me whatever. You{W:700} would{W:0} know all about her since you get along so well.
If you want to know anything about Senpai, just ask her.
God, you really don't get it. 
Don't get what?
Figure that out for yourself! 
O-Okay... You just want me to talk about Senpai, right? Uh, well...
She's a very cheerful, responsible, and dependable person.
I know that already!
Uh, so I met Senpai when we were on the student council. She did a lot of favors for me back then, and still does...
Favors?! Were they the lewd kind of "favors"?!
What do you mean by lewd? Of course not! She helped out with my work and brought me snacks. That kind of thing.
I've always thought it was strange, but it's not like you to join something like that. Did you volunteer?
Nope. I was gone for a week to learn how to make Zunda, and the school decided it for me. 
Onii-chan... You can't just up and skip class like that. I'm surprised your parents didn't stop you.
Haha. They gave up on me by the time I was in the seventh grade.
It's not something to laugh about. 
I got to meet Senpai because I left, and the Student Council wasn't all that bad.
You're happy to have met Nekohana-san, then?
Of course I am.
Hmm.... 
I'm done, by the way. How's it going for you?
I've been done for a while now.
Ooh, looking good. 
Of course it does. I made it, after all.
Haha, yeah. You're right. Want to do a taste-test and give each other feedback?
I gave it everything I had, so you better be grateful and give me your honest opinion.
Don't worry, I will.
It's fine, then. Here!
Here's some of mine. Let's try it... Mmm...
I'll try yours, too... Mmch...
It's tasty... How is it so refreshing? I could eat this forever and never get tired of how light it is!
Yours is great, too. Just eating it is making me smile.
Whew. You really are amazing, Onii-chan.
Nah, I've got a long way to go. You're the impressive one. I want to put your cake on the menu right now!
All right, let's clean up and head back to the dorms.
Sure.
No one's around... Did Nee-san go home already? Makes sense, given the time. 
It's gotten really late.
Talking about Senpai earlier really took me back. I'd always walk her home when our Student Council meetings ran late.
Nekohana-san was old enough to walk home by herself. She wasn't a kid.
That makes it even worse. There are some real weirdos out there.
You two weren't the only ones on the committee, right? What about the others?
You'd walk Nekohana-san home, but not them?
I don't see why it's such a big deal?
You two get along really well... But I won't lose!
Nono?
Take off your pants! 
Excuse me?!
