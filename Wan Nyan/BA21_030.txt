Good morning.
Oh, you're finally here. 
Were you waiting for me?
I thought we could do a study group with everyone. What do you think, Kenta-kun? 
A study group?
Even though this is an exam, we're still running a real business.
I want our customers to be glad they came, and for our tasty sweets to make them smile!
We need to amp up our skills for that! 
Oh, if that's your idea, I'm all for it! 
All right, then we'll meet up after we close up shop!
Gotcha!
