Ohohohohoh! Ooooooohohohoh!
Hana-san, that's amazing! 
Yes, it really is... 
Ohohohohoho! You're free to shower me with compliments!
Hana was revived at full force. 
It's true! All of us at the Kitty Parlor heard about all the good work you've been doing, too.
My, it really isn't that big a deal! 
Yuuko
Ah, then, hmm... The director is waiting, so we should really get to the store...
A cute girl spoke to Hana. 
She'd apparently shown up just to see Hana, and had the sort of kindness you wouldn't normally expect from an idol. I could see why she was popular.
Yuuko-chan... I hope I can get an autograph later. Hana-san, Hana-san, could you ask her for me? 
So long as it does not get in the way of the shooting... I suppose. It's almost time, so I'll be going. 
Hana walked proudly in large strides, with her teeth exposed in a grin.
...
Makoto, on the other hand, was walking toward her with a blank look on her face.
Ohohohohoh! How do you do, Makoto? If you're jealous, feel free to screech like a monkey.
But, Makoto... 
...
...walked past Hana, ignoring her completely!
Wha...?!
Hana's mouth fell open. 
Yikes... 
Wh-What's going on...?
You know, Makoto's from Nekonoya... 
Yuuko
Huh, Nekonoya? I just did a special there a little while ago! Their walnut mochi was really good!
The idol, who came to get Hana, chimed in happily.
...?! 
Yuuko
Aaaaaaah...?! I-I'm sorry...!
She quickly fell victim to Hana's terrifying gaze. The poor thing...
I see. Mako-chan probably doesn't think the media coverage is a big deal.
...! 
Hana started mumbling to herself. 
That damn Makoto... doesn't even think I'm worth acknowledging?!
No... That's not true... 
Be quiet, Yanushi-kun! 
Yes, ma'am... 
C-Calm down, Hana-san... You're showing way too much teeth...
Would you stop saying that, for the love of everything that's holy?! 
Either way, it's almost time to open the store. We'll be troubling the television crew if we continue to dawdle...
We headed toward Beans Puppy, all while trying to soothe the bitter and seething Hana.
