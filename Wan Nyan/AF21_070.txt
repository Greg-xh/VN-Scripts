Rustle...
I unintentionally nodded off and awoke to the sound of Hana sitting up from beside me.
Mm...?
When I opened my eyes, she stood up and started to dress in the middle of the dark room.
Ah. I'm sorry. Did I wake you up?
Heading back to your room?
Yes... I have to get up early tomorrow. 
It's really late. Why not spend the night here?
Yes... It's not a bad idea, but not tonight...
With that, Hana shook her head.
I had fun today. 
Me, too... Thanks, Hana. 
A-Ahaha! M-My oh my! Ah, erm... I'll be leaving, then... 
Click.
Hana scurried away in embarrassment and closed the door behind her. 
I watched her departure with a smile. She really was precious to me.
But... staving off the sandman was proving to be too difficult.
And my consciousness... once again... sank into the world of... dreams...
