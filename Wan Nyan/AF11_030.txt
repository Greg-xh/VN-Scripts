Oh, welcome back. 
Later that night, in the chairwoman's office...
After work, the Beans Puppy team walked back and were greeted by Makoto.
Mmm...? Where's Hana? 
She stayed behind. She wanted to "research some new sweet" to defeat you with.
Yikes. When is that girl gonna move on and stop picking fights with me?
Probably whenever she feels she's won.
So, when she defeats me?
I suppose so, yeah.
That's not good... I guess things are going to stay this way for a while, then.
You don't intend to let her beat you?
Of course not. Would anyone in their right mind just roll over and let someone else beat them? I won't let her win. With that said...
Mmm? What?
I've never thought I was superior to Hana, in any shape or form.
Huh...? Doesn't that mean Hana-san wins by default?
I guess so...? The feeling seems to be mutual, though...
I tried to suppress the smile creeping over my lips as I said that.
Huh? What do you mean, Onii-chan?
I think I'll go check on Hana after all. 
But, Yanushi... 
Their words fell on the deaf ears as I turned around and headed toward Beans Puppy.
And for some reason... I felt surprisingly happy. 
Maybe it was because I was right all along? Either way, despite appearances, the two of them really did share an incredible bond.
