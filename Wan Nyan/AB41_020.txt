Wow, that was awesome!
Mhm! I didn't know they were hosting a p｡tissier contest.
I never thought I'd see such world-class work up close. What a pleasant surprise!
Wasn't it amazing?! The way they worked was perfect, every movement was flawless, and every little thing they did seemed important!
It made me realize how inexperienced I am. What an incredibly eye-opening experience.
You look pretty happy, though.
Of course I am. I came face-to-face with what I want to someday become.
Man, I'm really itching to make some sweets right now...
Too bad. The kitchen's closed today!
Yeah... The kitchen in the dining hall isn't equipped for it, either. Ugh, I'll hold out until tomorrow.
Holding it in for a day will only pump you up more, and you'll end up making something even more amazing!
That's another way of looking at it. 
And besides, you gotta concentrate on your date with me now!
Right, I've gotta make the most of our day off with you.
You're only allowed to think about me, Onii-chan! I won't let you cheat on me, even if it's with cake!
I got it. 
Mhm, so long as you understand. Now that we've got that sorted out, let's head to the aquarium!
Yes, ma'am. I'll follow you to the ends of the Earth!
Hehe. Of course you would. That much is obvious.
Ahaha, yeah. 
Let's go, Onii-chan. Our date is only getting started!
