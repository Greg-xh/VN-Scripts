We spent the whole day together!
We did.
I had a lot of fun!
Uh-huh.
...A, B, C, D, E, F, G.
Yep.
Nincompoop!
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ouch! Don't pinch my cheek!
It's your own fault for spacing out!
I was not_
You did! You totally did! You definitely did!
That's not tr_
It{W:700} is{W:0} true! It's super true! It's definitely true!
Um... I was?
You were! Didn't you have fun with me?
That's not it. That's not it at all.
It doesn't look that way to me. 
I always have fun with you, Nono. I'm just worried about something...
Is it more important than being on a date with me?
No... I guess I can't get the thing with Senpai out of my mind...
{W:700}That's{W:0} your problem? I said so earlier, but she looked just fine to me.
She didn't look that way to me, though.
You're totally imagining it.
You really think I'm just seeing things?
Even if she were bummed out, you're worrying way too much.
Everyone feels down in the dumps sometimes. You'll wear yourself out if you worry about every little thing that happens.
I guess that's true...
Or maybe you care{W:700} because{W:0} it's Nekohana-san?
You usually forget or don't care enough to be bothered by this sort of thing.
Do you care about someone who{W:700} isn't{W:0} here, or the girl who's right next to you?
I'm sorry... This is all my bad. 
Tell me that's not it, Onii-chan. 
I... I...
I'm mad at you, you know? 
Figures... I'm sorry, I'm killing all your fun.
Do you love Nekohana-san, Onii-chan?
Huh? What makes you say that?
...Then, do you love me? 
That's a stupid question. Of course I love you.
...
I was going to tell you this after you remembered our promise, but it'll probably be too late by then.
So...
Nono?
Do you love me the same way I love you?
I think so.
Are you sure?
Why are you doubting me?
If you do, then that means you want to be my lover, right?
Ahaha. That's some weird build up for a joke.
See? I knew it.
Huh? ...That was a joke, right?
Onii-chan, you nincompoop... You forgot the promise you made me, and then call my confession a joke. I can't believe you!
I'm serious. I{W:700} really{W:0} want to be your girlfriend!
I've loved you ever since we were kids... All this time, even when you thought of me as a little sister!
W-Wait...
I won't wait! This is my chance to lay it all out there!
I don't want you to think about other girls anymore. I only want you to look at{W:700} me{W:0}...!
I'm serious about this. So long as I have you, I don't need anything else...
I'll give you everything I have, Onii-chan. Please do the same for me...
Nono, you...
She really was serious. Even someone as dense as me could see how honest she was being about this.
I'd never noticed it, but she always...
Don't you have anything to say?!
Honestly, I'm surprised... I never knew you felt that way about me...
It made sense why she wanted to be lovers now.
And she really hated it when I treated her like a kid...
It just proves you weren't looking at me!
She was absolutely right. Was I ever looking at her?
I couldn't be this pathetic, but...
I'm glad you feel that way, but I don't know how to respond right now.
You've got a lot of pointless things on your mind right now...
...So I'll make it so you can only think about me...!
