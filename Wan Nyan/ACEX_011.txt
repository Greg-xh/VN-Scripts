What's the matter, Yanushi-kun? Are you feeling unwell?
Oh, Hana.
A good morning to you, Yanushi-kun. You're up early today. Are you alone here?
I'm over here, you know.
My, I hadn't noticed. Your presence is just so small, ohohohoh. 
Hana provoked her, with her eyes pointed at Makoto's chest. She must've been referring to her bust size.
Makoto's eyes became noticeably sharp. If this were a manga, a vein would most certainly be popping out of her head with a "Snap!" sound effect right about now.
Yanushi-kun, Yanushi-kun, what's wrong? Are you injured? Did Makoto hurt you?
No, that's not what... 
If anything's wrong, please let me know. Your body isn't just yours, you know?
Th-Thanks, but I'm fine. I just fell off my bed when trying to turn off my alarm clock. Talk about clumsy, huh?
My, not at all... Everyone makes mistakes sometimes. 
Hana... You're so kind. 
Oh, nonsense. That just comes with being a girl.  
Hana giggled shyly as her cheeks flushed pink. That feminine gesture was so charming.
Even if she was a little rough around the edges, I knew she was still a cute, feminine girl at heart.
Ohoh, you two get along{W:700} so{W:0} well!
Uu...!
I hadn't noticed Makoto closing in on me from behind. What was this murderous vibe she was giving off...? If this were a battlefield, I'd be dead by now!
Why, of course. Yanushi-kun and I are... 
Hana's gaze turned elsewhere and she fidgeted bashfully in place. This flowery aura was truly befitting of her name.
Heheheheh...
Makoto, on the other hand... was projecting a dark aura that made said flowers wither away and die.
M-Makoto...?
I don't really care, but I've got breakfast to make. You're in the way, so buzz off. 
Me, in the way?! 
Uhh, I'll help. 
Don't. You can go play hanky-panky with Hana some more. 
I can?
Of course you can't! Do you want to know what it's like to fall from somewhere higher than your bed?
No, ma'am...
