Haaaa... Aah! Mmm, Haaaaaa... Aaaah... Aaaaaaaaaaaah...
I walked into my room and threw myself onto my bed, filling the space with a mixture of sighs and yawns.
(What did I do to Michiyo-san...? Did I offend her somehow?)
And, naturally, Michiyo-san was on my mind. 
Hina seemed convinced I'd done everything I could and shouldn't dwell on it any further, but I couldn't help it.
No matter how much I thought about it, nothing came to mind. Michiyo-san seemed so happy before...
(I figured she'd be happy to see me again... She'd greet me with a smile and say she missed me, so... why?)
Mm... Ah, it's already this late... 
After sighing for the umpteenth time, I glanced at the clock. It was past the girls' bath time, and I was now free to take a shower.
(Maybe I'll take a bath... Getting a nice, hot soak might help wash all the gloom away...)
I headed for the bath, convinced I would fall asleep if I stayed on that bed any longer...
