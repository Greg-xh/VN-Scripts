How's it going?
Ah, Onii-chan.
I came up with a few designs. Which one do you like the most?
Let's see... Oooh, they're all cute. 
Really?
I wouldn't lie to you. Girls really are better at these sorts of things, huh?
Hmm... It really is hard to choose, though...
Hehe. Yeah, it is. Just rack your brain!
They like dogs, right?
Yeah. She's apparently raising seven dogs.
That's incredible... In that case, this one is perfect.
Ah. I was really proud of how that one turned out. You've got a great eye for this!
Yeah, it's good. I'm sure the birthday girl will love it.
All right! I'll go with this design.
By the way, why are you still in your uniform?
Oh, I went out with Senpai for a bit after work.
With Nekohana-san? Where did did you go, exactly?
To her place. She had to pick up some stuff, so I walked her home. It's dangerous to walk around at this time of night, after all.
You went to Nekohana-san's house...? Do you go there often? 
No, I haven't visited the place in years. Maybe that's why her mom was really happy to see me. 
Huh? You know Nekohana-san's mom? 
Sort of. I used to hang out at her house a lot when we were in school.
Grr... That's the first I've heard of it!
Well, yeah.
You and Nekohana-san are a little{W:700} too{W:0} friendly!
I guess so?
Who do you like more, her or me?
I can't choose... I've never compared you two, either.
Nekohana-san sure is wonderful! She's bright, cheerful, and kind. She's really pretty, too!
Yeah, she's a great person. I owe her a lot, and I'm glad we're friends.
You{W:700} owe{W:0} her? What has she done for you, exactly?!
What's wrong? You look mad.
Onii-chan, you nincompoop! 
What's that for...? Is something wrong?
I'm a girl, too, you know!
Yeah. I, uh, know that.
Do you really? I don't think you do!
I really don't think that's right. 
Prove it, then!
I'd love to, but how?
Have sex with me!
Again?
Did you just... Didn't you like it? Do you think I'm ugly?
That's not it! I'm just not sure if that's really okay.
Of course it is! Love me, just like you did last time!
All right... I'm not sure what I did to piss you off, but I'll show you just how important you are to me.
Yeah, do it.
Nono...
Onii-chan...
