When I came to this world, I was surprised by how different it was from my original world. But there are some similarities, too.
One such example is the sport of tennis.
The equipment and rules are a little different, but just like in my world, it's a sport for rich ladies to socialize.
Curious about the tennis in my world, Naomin's dark elf mother, Muhnmuhn-san, invited me over to her tennis club.
"Show us what tennis is like in your world," she asked calmly, but with the look of a cougar eying its prey. So of course, I agreed.
I've played the strip tennis mobile game, "Sexy Cat Tennis," so you can say I'm a tennis expert. I won't let Muhnmuhn-san down.
What I'm concerned about lies somewhere else... Will my HP... that is, my hip point's hit points, be enough!?
They're elves, whose beauty far outstrips that of human women. And I'll be the only man there. A tennis match made in heaven.
The souls of heroes have graced my lower half. It's a matter of time before I pop a "grand slam," if you know what I mean.
