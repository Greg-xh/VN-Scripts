"Thank you so much for saving me from those ogre bandits!"
"Pssh, with my magic, even Amazons like those are no match for me!"
"The way you were slaying one after another with your mighty, ahem, sword was so manly... It kind of made me want to, umm..."
Tiana-chan, the mermaid girl I've just saved, is fidgeting and struggling to meet my gaze. Her face is tomato-red.
Despite being a mermaid, her bottom half is completely human right now. I suppose they have to use some kind of magic to walk.
Today, she's travelling to Yggdrasil Academy with her attendants to prepare to join the school.
But on the way, they were attacked by ogre bandits, and I just happened to be walking by at the right time. I used my Ero-Magic to "pacify" them.
After taking about thirty "critical hits" from my Ecstasy Burst-enhanced sword, I don't think they'll be walking for a while.
"I'd like to repay you somehow. Would you like to come to my mansion? I'll give you anything you want when we're there..."
An invitation to the home of a huge-honkered hottie? You don't have to ask me twice!
"I would very much like to take you up on that offer!"
"Very well, let us go..."
