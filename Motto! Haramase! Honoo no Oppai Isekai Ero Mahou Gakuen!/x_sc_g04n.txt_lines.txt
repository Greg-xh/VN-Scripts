"This is... a love hotel, isn't it?"
"Is this your first time going to a love hotel, Catherine-senpai?"
"O-Of course it is! Why would someone like me ever come to a place like this?"
"Well... This was the only hotel I could find with a vacancy."
"We have to extend today's quest. And thanks to the big Comic Excite 93 event, most of the regular hotels are all booked."
"Ditto with all the carriages and airships. Everything's been booked for months thanks to Comic Excite."
The more things change, the more they stay the same, I guess.
"R-Right... Well, I'm going to take a shower... E-Eeek! The door, it's made of glass! You'll be able to see everything!"
"Well... It is a love hotel, after all..."
"Then, while I'm in there, can you please look the other way? I don't want you staring at me while I shower."
"As you wish, m'lady! A gentleman such as I wouldn't even dream of peeping, oh no!"
A gentleman whose dick does all the thinking clearly has other ideas, however.
"Ahh... Mmm... Phew... What a nice shower... So relaxing... Heeheehee."
The hiss of the shower... and Catherine-senpai's lovely voice!
Seeing her is like being beckoned into a holy world... But... still!
"Huh!?"
I feel the familiar tingle of Ero-Magic descending upon me, as though the gods themselves have come to my aid.
"The Sexy Cosplaying Archpriest"... Oh really? Time for a little more Ero-Magic... And to confess my love for Catherine-senpai's boobs!
Masked by the sound of the shower, I activate the Ero-Magic.
