A hallway in Yggdrasil Girls' Magical Academy.
I scarf down my lunch, which is a sandwich I got at the school convenience store, and then head over to the nurse's office.
And why is that? As a matter of fact, Catherine- senpai wants to see me for a "Magic Body Scan."
A Magic Body Scan is pretty much self- explanatory. It's an apparently mandatory checkup of your body, magic ability, and MP.
But with Catherine-senpai's T cups dangling right in front of me, I worry about the kind of results she's gonna get.
Even just the thought of her is already raising me to half-mast.
I'm so glad to be seeing her that I'm actually skipping down the hall...
"Hmm?"
I'm suddenly struck by Ero-Magic.
"Ero-Magic Body Scan"!?
It's literally exactly the same as the checkup I'm on my way to, but with "Ero" tacked on. I like where this is headed.
Who would have thought that the simple addition of three little letters could make something so much better?
I think I'm looking forward to this erotic take on the body scan!
Without a hint of hesitation, I activate this new Ero-Magic spell.
"What's happening?"
"Hello! Come right in."
I hear Catherine-senpai's soothing, almost motherly voice on the other side of the door.
Ohh yeeeah. ♪ It's like music to my ears. This is gonna be fun.
With my interest (and dick) very much piqued, I open the door in a hurry.
