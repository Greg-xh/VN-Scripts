"Man... Even in a fantasy world, studying sucks."
If only I were almighty in proper magic as well. I wouldn't be sighing like this, then...
I've got no internet, no smartphone, and no games. So, outside of academy activities, I've got way too much free time on my hands.
I recall what I learned in the last lecture, strike a pretentious pose, and say a silly spell. But nothing happens... Why's this so hard!?
Just as I start losing all hope...
"Huh!? In the name of all that is good and horny, what is that light seeping from that bag...!?"
The one magical item I always carry around, the "eroticrystal," starts reacting faintly, but quite noticeably.
What sights does it have in store for me today? I giddily peer into the crystal.
"Mmgh... Aah... Haah... Ahh... Mmgh... Ugh..."
The crystal shows me Kashnia-san. Not the pretentious, snappy vampire Kashnia, but the horny, writhing Kashnia.
(She's an idiot, but... I guess idiots gotta masturbate too.)
"Ahhh... Mm, mmgh... Haah... Ahhh... Mmgh..."
"Man, she's so damn cute when she's like this. She's still an idiot, though..."
While her idiotic demeanor often overshadows her sexiness, I can't watch her languish like this and %i1not%r feel something in my pants.
My lower half is already preparing for war.
"Sexier than sex, let my desires resound! Transfer my lust to her hairless mound!"
In my arousal, I casually chant an incantation. The crystal responds by shining brighter.
