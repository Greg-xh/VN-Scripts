Today in dungeon training, Phee and I are meant to form a party, go three floors below ground level, and retrieve a talisman.
We already managed to get our hands on the talisman and are now on our way home.
Thing is, she's seemed restless since the start. She's supposed to be protecting me in battle mode, but I feel like I have to protect her now.
"Phee? Somethin' wrong? You gotta pee? I'll watch over you if you wanna take a quick whiz."
"I-I'm fine..."
Phee goes completely red-faced and fidgety at my totally shameless suggestion.
But she's been clinging to me with those colossal cans of hers pressing up against me for a while now... Damn, she's cute.
"Wait... You're not claustrophobic or something, are you?"
"Bwuh? Th-That's not... I'm not... S-S-Senpai!"
Now that I've asked her while giving her nipples a nice squeeze... I can say for sure she definitely doesn't like dark, cramped spaces.
A homunculus who gets freaked out in dungeons? Well, shiiit.
Oh well... We already got the talisman, so let's GTFO. Unfortunately, I don't know any magic to take us back home, so we're stuck walking.
"Hmm?"
Just as I'm getting all down on myself for not being able to use any kind of return spell, a new Ero-Magic is bestowed upon me.
Dungeon Escape Magic: I'm Bringing Sex Evac!
Could just be me, but that name sounds pretty damn promising.
It kinda sounds like an old song I heard once, but I could just be imagining things.
Anyway, I'm gonna use this thing right here and right now.
The second I incant the spell, we're surrounded by a white light that seems to push us to the brightly lit exit of the dungeon.
