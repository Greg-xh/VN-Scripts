"Mm... Mmmgh..."
"Ah! Eh? Ugh..."
"Owww... Hmm? Where am I?"
When I come to, I find myself staring at a flawless, regal-looking ceiling.
White sheets, a fluffy bed, the smell of sanitary chemicals... This must be the nurse's office.
And right beside me is...
"...*sniffle*... Takumi..."
"Huh? Oh, Naomin? What's wrong?"
"..."
"Hey, it's not like you to look at me like that. Are you... Whoa!?"
"Takumi! I'm so glad you're awake! I'm sorry, it's my fault!"
"What's going on? 'Sorry' is the last word I'd expect to hear from your lips."
"But... But... *sniffle*..."
Tears fill her ruby red eyes, causing them to shine brighter and deeper.
Ummmm, did something happen today...?
Oh, right... The practice quest...
Naomin and I were supposed to fight the mythical beast known as the "Leviathan." At our level, it should've been a cinch.
What we actually came across, however, was a different monster.
We fought a similar, but higher-ranked "Lord Viathan." The difference is that it's got a more formal title, and a slight color difference.
Its appearance is like that of a little mermaid, so I underestimated it. That was a mistake.
Since Naomin can't move while casting spells, that thing took the opportunity to launch a high-speed tail attack at her.
My body quickly sprang into motion and pushed her away... At least, I think that's what happened.
All I know is that I felt a huge impact before losing consciousness...
And now, I've found myself here.
"D-Did you get hit on the head? Your back? Your shoulders? Does it hurt anywhere?"
She normally flings abuse as plentiful as magic missiles at me, but now she's trembling while holding my fallen form.
(Hmm... At least she seems unhurt. That's good.)
"I clearly misread the situation. I should've set up our defenses before switching to attack magic. I was too impatient..."
"As long as your spells land, they'll wipe out most of the enemy's HP. It makes sense for a mage to prioritize offense."
"But that strategy put you in such grave danger... I'm so sorry..."
It's unlike her to apologize so much. I bet she wants to make up for it somehow. That's usually how things go.
"That's enough apologizing. Accidents like these are a common enough occurrence, aren't they? Don't let 'em get to you."
"...*sniffle*..."
"...Wait, what? Were you crying? Your eyes are red."
"Th-They've always been red! And I wasn't crying!"
"Huh? But there are tears rolling down your cheeks..."
"I-It's not like I was crying for your sake! I-It was... You know...?"
"I was frustrated that I couldn't protect you, which is why I was... n't crying! I-I just got something in my eyes, that's all!"
"And that something was tears, right?"
"A-Anyway, um... If there's anything I can do, then say it already! It's not like I %i1won't %r do it, depending on what it is."
She offers to nurse me in a truly tsundere fashion.
That's when... a new Ero-Magic descends upon me with perfect timing.
(Hmm...? What's up with this...? It doesn't have a name.)
All that's written in the magical square is "???", so I have no idea what sort of magic this is...
Regardless of the result it might have, it'd be tasteless of me to squander this opportunity to try it out.
"Ah... well... I'm a little thirsty, so let me drink from your boobs, Naomin."
"Huh!?"
Taken aback, she falls silent and hangs her head.
She soon raises it back up, though, and shyly whispers in reply.
"O-Oh, fine... But just for today, okay...?"
Her face flushes as she sidles up next to me.
