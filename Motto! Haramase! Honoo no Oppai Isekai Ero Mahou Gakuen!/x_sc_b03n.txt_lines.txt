"...Huh."
With lectures finished for the day, while heading back to my room, I spot a pale crystal ball blinking on and off.
Normally, I'd spend my free time playing games or watching porn, but this world has neither electronics nor the internet.
Well. It's not like this place doesn't have %i1anything%r fun.
Take this crystal ball, for example. Even the people who live in this dull realm need security systems, making these suckers a popular item.
"Hey, Crystal! Show me something %i1dirty%r.'"
"I mean, it'd be a waste not to use my magic to say, spy on some ladies getting changed."
When I clap my hands in front of the crystal ball, it lights up—kind of like a phone's home screen unlocking.
I lean in, as a hazy image of something pink and fleshy appears in the center.
"N-No way!"
Against all odds, my prayers have been answered—it's a live feed of some girl going to town on herself.
"Whoa, damn! And just who might this sweet, shameful little pussy belong to?"
I move my hands closer to the crystal ball, leaving them hovering over the surface as I peer into the center.
"Mnn! Ah, a-aah...! Hff... A-Aaahn!"
That voice, those formidable boobs... Make no mistake, today's lucky lady is...
"The masochistic crusader, of course. I'd know that stupidly sexy figure of hers %i1anywhere%r!"
I gaze into the crystal ball, watching as Olga deftly fondles her boobs and pussy, moaning positively indecently.
"Oooh..."
The scene is so sublime, it's literally breathtaking.
She kicks and clenches her bed sheets, the depth of the wrinkles and folds an erotically clear indication of how deeply she's enjoying herself.
It looks like those sheets are about to knot her up inside them. Yeeeeah, you're feelin' it aren't you? You naughty knight!
"I'm gonna remember this sight for all eternity!"
I stare hungrily into the crystal ball, taking in every second of Olga pleasuring herself.
