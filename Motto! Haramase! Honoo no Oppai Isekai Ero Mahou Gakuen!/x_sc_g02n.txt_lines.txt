"Senpai! Are you there?"
Light shines through the stained glass, casting a beautiful image across the floor.
I'm in a church in the village near the school.
"That's odd. Catherine-senpai should be here... Ohhh Senpaaai!"
I'm here today for a training quest.
It's for a class where you choose a low- level quest to clear from the school guild.
These quests usually involve monsters. I'm supposed to do battle with those slimes you find in those old-school RPGs, so it should be a cakewalk.
"I know I shouldn't be afraid of a few puny slimes, but..."
I can't help but play out a couple of stressful scenarios in my head.
(This is totally the kind of place where something really nasty could happen!)
That's when I sense something coming.
And then...
"Takumi-kun! Watch out!"
I hear a bloodcurdling scream and make a mad dash to investigate.
