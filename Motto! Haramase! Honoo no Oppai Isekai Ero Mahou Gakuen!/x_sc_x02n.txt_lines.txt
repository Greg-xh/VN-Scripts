Thanks to my Ero-Magic, today, the fantasy world maid café, "Moon Doria," is a %i1bit%r different...
"Meow! Well, come-meown in!"
"Please have a seat, Senpai... meow."
"Haah... Why do I have to do this...? Yeah, sure. Whatever. Meow meow."
It is now a "cat café."
Not a café with real cats, but a heaven where all the employees have become "catgirls."
A place where catgirl maids in cute costumes tend to your every need!
"Whoa... So this is what the Ero-Magic 'One-Day Cat Café' was about... It's a café with titty kitty catgirls in heat! Neat!"
There's one kinda grumpy cat among the bunch, but I'm gonna thoroughly enjoy their customer service.
