Today, I find myself in a horse-drawn carriage heading to a fancy ball, on the invitation of Olga's mother, Maria-san.
To everyone outside the carriage, it would be appear to be nothing but the kind any old noble would ride around in. However...
"Man, this Ero-Magic stuff can pull off some crazy things sometimes. You can see right through the wallpaper too, wow."
My powers have transformed the whole carriage into a strange kind of magic mirror, allowing us to look out at the unknowing passers-by.
The wall to which Olga and her mother find their asses pressed is completely transparent, and beyond, I can see folk going about their lives.
