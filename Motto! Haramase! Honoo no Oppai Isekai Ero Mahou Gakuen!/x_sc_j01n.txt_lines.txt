What's my next class again? Swimming? Why's there so much swimming here, anyway?
Is someone trying to get some alone time with me?
Yeah, I wish... Haahn... I really got into that erotic novel last night. Sarah-san, the school's shopkeeper that recommended the novel to me, sure is something!
Who in their right mind would recommend a student a book like that? I couldn't put it down!
I just wanna rip off one of these girls' skirts and—
"Takumi-nii? Are you okay? Did you stay up all night doing naughty things again?"
"M-Mizore? H-Hahaha, of course not! I was just doing some studying. I must've gotten carried away!"
How does she always manage to pop up at just the right moment?
"Oh really...?"
This is making it look like I'M the pervert!
"Fine. It was this erotic novel. It started off as some curious light reading, then..."
"I knew you were a pervert all along."
Why does everyone keep calling me that?
Anyway, is Mizore-chan in my next class too?
"Ah!"
That Ero-Magic came on fast.
All I did was imagine being in the same pool as Mizore-chan. My imagination is already running wild!
I want her so bad. I chant my Ero-Magic as I fantasize the most amazing pool scene ever.
